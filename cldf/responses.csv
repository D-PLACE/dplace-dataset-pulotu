18336,nukuoro,86,2,150-2,"“During Kubary’s day, all natives lived on the southern tip of the island in a much crowded village.” (Eilers, 1934, p. 198)

“The head of the community is still the ‘King’ (Ariki toholiki). His family, being very old, is said to be descended from the Samoan conquerors, with Wawe being the first in the line of succession. The royal power, being representative from the beginning, embodies what is lawful by custom and tradition. Within this compass, the King is entitled to give orders and to demand obedience; tyranny is, thus, impossible. Economically, the King is not necessarily better off than the wealthy people of the island. … Next to the king, the high priest had much influence upon the administration of public affairs, which is obvious from his title ariki takatonga, or, ariki sili (sili = the more important one).” (Eilers, 1934, p. 221)","eilers-1934[198, 221]"

19910,aeta,86,3,150-3,"""Those Negritos still living in a wild state have very simple government. They simply gather around the most powerful man, whom they recognize as a sort of chief and whom they follow into raids on the plains or neighboring tribes of Negritos. But when living peaceably scattered through their mountains each head of a family is a small autocrat and rules his family and those of his sons who elect to remain with him. When he dies the oldest son becomes the head of the family. Usually, however, a group of families living in one locality recognizes one man as a capitan. He may be chosen by the president of the nearest pueblo or by the Negritos themselves, who are quick to recognize in this way superior ability or greater wealth. The capitan settles disputes between families."" (Reed, 1903, p. 70)

“Three levels of organization can be recognized in Zambales Negrito society: the nuclear family, the ‘camp’ and the sakop … A number of researchers have commented on the unusual degree of communal ness among the Zambales Negritos. Fox (1952:247) notes that ‘Negrito life is basically communal.’ Tima (personal communication) has made a similar observa- [136] tion … Unless staying by themselves, or in larger, more permanent settlements, nuclear families almost never cook and eat by themselves. Cooking is a collective endeavor. The same applies to procuring food. Many swiddens within the research area are cleared and cultivated by two or three families. Alternately, families in a camp may procure food from each other's swiddens. A hypothetical three-family localized settlement group may have between four and seven swiddens under cultivation at a single time. When procuring food, members of this group may visit any of these swiddens on successive days … The third level of integration is the sakop or neighborhood. These sakop are recognized, named areas, averaging between 15 and 20 square kilometers in size. These are not discrete, bounded territories. They are inhabited largely by several kin groups One social institution may be further mentioned here which relates to the socio-political dimension of the sakop. Each sakop has a kapitan. This is an in? fluential individual who functions as a mediator of both internal and external conflict or who, in the case of open conflict, may assume a leadership role based on popular support. Obviously the term kapitan has been borrowed from the Spanish, and the assumption has been that the institution itself was imposed on the Negritos during the Spanish colonial period. Such an explanation is inadequate. The Spanish had notoriously bad luck in pacifying and settling Negritos throughout the Philip- [137] pines till the very end of their tenure there. Their contact with interior Negritos was limited to infrequent punitive actions. Administratively, they never did penetrate this area. Yet by the turn of the present century this institution was firmly entrenched among the Zambales Negritos (Norbeck 1956, Parker 1964, Reed 1904). It is suggested, preliminarily, that this institution has its origins in pre-hispanic Sambal society, and relates most directly to conflict and alliance. The Negritos continue to espouse a strong ideology of conflict, though almost always stated in the idiom of defense. The kapitan is frequently mentioned in this context.” (Brosius, 1983, pp. 135-137)",reed1904[70];brosius-1983

21368,siraya,85,2,151-2,"‘Account of the inhabitants’ (Candidius, quoted in Campbell, 1903, pp. 9-25)

""These villages have no general chief who rules over them, but each village is independent. Nor has any village its own head-man who governs it; although it may have a nominal council, consisting of twelve men of good repute. Every two years the councillors lay down their office, and others are chosen in their stead. Councillors must be about forty years of age, and all of them of the same age. Although they know nothing of the number of years, and no, one really knows how long he has lived, still they do remember on what day, and in what year and month, they were born. When coun- cillors have been in oiEce two years, each causes the hair on both sides of his forehead to be plucked out, which is a sign that he has fulfilled his term and is no longer in office. Then, other councillors of the same age are chosen.

“The dignity and power of the councillors, however, is not so great that their laws must be obeyed or their commands listened to; but whenever a difficulty arises they meet, and deliberate about the best way of solving it. Having come to a decision they call all the people of the village together to one of the palaver or idol houses, the question is propounded, and for half an hour they discuss the pros and cons of the matter. When one speaker is tired, another takes his place, and they thus endeavour, by dint of many words, to persuade the people to accept their proposal. Perfect order is maintained; for, while an orator is speaking, no one would think of interrupting him, though there were a thousand hearers. At their eloquence I have been thoroughly astonished, for I actually believe Demosthenes himself could not have been more eloquent or have had a greater selection of words at his command. The councillors having finished speaking, the people deliberate about the proposal among themselves; and they may accept what the councillors propose or not, as they think fit. There is no compulsion; every one judging for himself of the advantages or disadvantages of the proposal.

""It is also part of a councillor's office to see that the commands of their priestesses are duly obeyed, and to prevent everything that they fancy may provoke the anger of their gods. Whenever anything has occurred which [16] they think may incense their gods, or when a private interest is at stake, these twelve persons are considered competent to judge concerning the matter, and they have the power to inflict certain punishments. These punishments never take the form of imprisonment, chains, or any other corporal punishment; but of fines, it may be of some piece of clothing, a deer skin, or a jar of their strong drink, according to the offence."" (Candidius, quoted in Campbell, 1903, pp. 15-16)

“All other nations that I have ever known have male priests, popes, or teachers, who instruct the people and are the priests of their gods; but this nation has only priestesses, whom they call Inibs. The public service these Inibs perform in a religious capacity is twofold ; calling upon their gods and bringing sacrifices to them, which sacrifices are chiefly offered in their temples, and consist of slaughtered pigs, cooked rice, pinang, and a great quantity of their beverage, as also the heads of stags and swine.""

17733,eastern-sumbanese,86,3,150-3,"""The population of Eastern Sumba is divided among numerous, typically small and (in former times) largely autonomous traditional domains each comprising a number of distinguishable villages and hamlets and inhabited by segments of a number of patrilineal clans ... The domain is called tana or paraingu ... Apart from indicating the territory as a whole, paraingu is also used to refer specifically to the chief village of a domain ... This double meaning of the term is consistent with a traditional pattern of settlement found throughout eastern Sumba, in which the ancestral houses and graves of the ruling nobility and commoner clans longest established in the [46] domain are located in the chief village. The pattern varies from place to place, however; and in Rindi, besides the houses of the noble clan, only those of four commoner clans which hold special ritual duties were ever situated in the principal village of the domain ... The majority of Rindi clans have thus always resided in subsidiary villages that surround the chief village."" (Forth, 1981, pp 45-46)

“The higher or major nobility (maràmba bokulu) are distinguished from the lower or minor nobility (maràmba kudu) as persons who derive solely from forbears of noble rank ... [222] ... As throughout eastern Sumba, the nobility in Rindi are the political rulers of the domain. Leadership, however, is more particularly accorded to the most senior of the higher ranking (maràmba bokulu) lineages of the noble clan, and then to the eldest or senior man of that group; so in some contexts maràmba is used to refer specifically to a single lineage (in Rindi the group called Uma Penji) or to the individual noble leader. The individual ruler can also be distinguished as the 'staff' (tokungu), referring to the symbol of office presented by the Dutch Colonial authorities.” (Forth, 1981, pp 221-222)

""Because the traditional power of the maramba is no longer recognized by the government, what follows is in part a reconstruction. The impression of noble leadership conveyed by earlier writers (see, e.g., Roos 1872:5-8) is one of a rather diffuse and arbitrary form of rule; and by all accounts the eastern Subamese nobility during the nineteenth century governed in a harsh and autocratic manner. While to some extent the nobiity acted as guardians of public order, and in Rindi are still sometimes called upon to offer advice in litigation between free clansmen, following Roos (1872:5) such intervention was unsystematic and motivated largely by self-interest... ""Perhaps the most important function of the nobility in Rindi, however, was the leadership they provided in all matters relating to war and the defense of the domain. In this and in other respects, their power largely derived from their great wealth and, especially, from their possession of large numbers of slaved, who could be deployed as both a military and a civil force.

19001,lakalai,84,2,149-2,"The only religious specialists mentioned in Valentine’s (1965) description of Lakalai religion are ‘magicians’ and mediums. The author says little about the former and explicitly denies that the latter occupied formal offices. However, this account excludes religious phenomena not directly related to supernatural agents:

""The present account is focused upon the beliefs which the Lakalai hold and the behaviour in which they engage with respect to traditional spirit-beings … The large body of Lakalai magic which has no direct connexion with spirit-beings is reserved for future description."" (Valentine, 1965, p. 163)

""Mediums were usually important men, but their position does not appear to have been specifically formalised."" (Valentine, 1965, p. 187)

Under ‘religious specialists’ in the EOWC:

""Specialist magicians perform garden magic for the benefit of coresidents; specialist war magicians were equally useful in the past. Weather magicians are often hired to bring or prevent rain. Most men know spells for love magic, hunting, and fishing. Most older men are thought to know death-dealing sorcery, but deaths tend to be blamed on a few whose ancestors were renowned sorcerers. Both sexes rescue souls captured by ghosts and act as curers. Women are most likely to know magic relating to female fertility and child growth."" (Chowning, 1991, p 142)

Chowning and Goodenough (1965) provide more information about these magicians:

""The several hamlets of a village regularly make their gardens together … The two services that are connected with gardening and that individuals contribute to the entire village community are fencing against wild pigs and garden magic. Each man is responsible for the garden fence beside his plot … The unity of the village garden appears more clearly in connection with taro magic. In each village there is one person who is recognized as garden magician. While others know some garden magic, only one person holds the office of garden magician in a  … It is within the magician's power to cause crops to wither as well as to flourish. But since his spells affect all plants in the garden equally, he cannot injure the crops of others without destroying his own at the same time … Unlike many other specialists who charge for their services, a garden magician performs on behalf of the village without pay. We may, therefore, designate his as a public office."" (Chowning & Goodenough, 1965, p. 434)

""Other specialists who perform for the entire community without charge, and whom we may designate public officials, are the leader of wild pig drives, done with nets, and the war leader. The former is, presumably, always the head of a pig net pool. He appears to be selected by the heads of the other netting pools as the one among them who is the most knowledgeable pig hunter, from both the practical and the magical standpoints … There are other specialists, such as weather magician and diviner, who provide services that the Lakalai feel should be available in every community. They ordinarily expect a fee, however, except when performing for sibmates and consanguineal kinsmen. On the other hand, a Lakalai expects the fee to be higher if he must import a specialist from another village. The larger the village, the greater the likelihood that all of the essential services will be available to its residents from a fellow villager, who is expected not to refuse to serve when asked, nor to over-charge. A one-hamlet village is at a disadvantage and must often do without the benefit of specialists. Whether they function as public officials or not, the presence of the various specialists and the demand for their services emphasizes the interdependence of the several hamlets in a village and contributes to the sense of community among them."" (Chowning & Goodenough, 1965, p. 435)

Relationship between villages within a territory:

""Common interests include preservation of the equal rights of all territorial residents to hunt and gather throughout the territory, to travel within its confines unmolested, to enjoy the support of other villages in war and take refuge with other villages when attacked. The members of any hamlet or village undertaking an important ceremony expect attendance and active participation from all their territory mates.""

19002,lakalai,85,3,151-3,"Chowning and Goodenough (1965) provide a detailed description of ‘Lakalai political organization’. 

Political leadership was associated with membership in two 'wristband societies' called savarasi and suara, named after the magical wristbands that their members (who appear to have been identified by the names of the societies that they belonged to) were entitled to wear. Savarasi were 'hamlet leaders' whose primary role appears to have been to resolve disputes. Suara were peacekeepers as well as warriors. 'War leaders' were usually suara, though apparently this was not an absolute pre-requisite. The office of 'village chief' (valipoi), described as the 'highest political office', appears to have always been occupied by a suara:

""A special type of partnership involves co-membership in a wristband society. There are several such societies, each with a distinctive wristband, the generic name for which is mileki. Some are more important than others. Two are especially important politically. They are the savarasi and suara societies, the former associated with hamlet leadership and the latter with leadership in war. Membership in the suara society is also a prerequisite to selection for the highest political office, that of valipoi."" (Chowning & Goodenough, 1965, p. 420)

""One wristband, named savarasi, is specifically associated with hamlet leadership … When a man becomes prominent in his hamlet, he asks the members of this wristband society to invest him with the savarasi, which he wears on his left wrist … Putting on the savarasi indicates that the man is now freed from heavy labour, for which he depends on others, though not from all work. He also has a special ability to stop quarrels. This ability seems to derive in part from fear of the spirit in the wristband and in part from the backing of other men who have the same wristband. There may be from one to four savarasi in a hamlet, and they are given pay by the leaders of other hamlets when they go to visit. Investment with the savarasi, then, formally ratifies a man's position as a hamlet leader and joins him in a special partnership with other hamlet leaders, who owe and normally show him a great deal of formal courtesy. It also enhances his authority within his hamlet, giving him magical peacekeeping powers … To be noted now is the absence of an exclusive office that can be labelled 'hamlet chief. There are social ranks based on age, kinship, accomplishment, and membership in wristband societies. A hamlet may be headed by one man who clearly outranks all others or by several men of roughly equal rank."" (Chowning & Goodenough, 1965, p. 432)

""The office of war leader is a thing of the past. To fill it, a man had to prove his ability as fighter and war magician and, if possible, he was also a wearer of the suara wristband. In former times a village of any size could usually count several suara. Ideally, each sib that owned land locally had a suara among its members. Their great supernatural powers made suara effective settlers of disputes as well as formidable warriors, and they played an important role in maintaining order within the village. Apparently the most skilled among them was the village's war leader. He directed military operations in which the village as a whole was involved ... Most important for village unity was the now defunct office of valipoi. Selected from among the local suara by unanimous consent of the village's promiment men, the valipoi had the power to make ultimate decisions regarding war and peace, the settlement of internal disputes, and other matters directly affecting the collective safety and welfare of the village's members. We may properly speak of him has the village chief."" (Chowning & Goodenough, 1965, pp 434-435). 

Apart from the war leader (who is described as having also been a war magician), the leadership roles described above appear to have been secular ones, although underpinned by the magical powers of the savarasi and suara bracelets.

More on war magic, which suggests that it was not vested in any one particular office:

""Leading warriors and sib heads performed war magic for the military party before it set out, but individuals also recited private spells at the battlefield."" (Chowning & Goodenough, 1965, p. 452)

There were a number of magicians who performed on behalf of the village. Their relationship to the valipoi is not entirely clear:

""The unity of the village garden appears more clearly in connection with taro magic. In each village there is one person who is recognized as garden magician. While others know some garden magic, only one person holds the office of garden magician in a village ... The office passes to the most senior person among those of his heirs to whom he teaches the necessary rites ... In 1954 Galilo had one principal garden magician, Kulei, headman of Kato hamlet and village luluai. He performed the magic for one of the two village gardens, the one with which he was himself associated ... Unlike many other specialists who charge for their services, a garden magician performs on behalf of the village without pay. We may, therefore, designate his a public office.

[435] ""Other specialists who perform for the entire community without charge, and whom we may designate public officials, are the leaders of wild pig drives, done with nets, and the war leader ..."" (Chowning & Goodenough, 1965, p. 434-435)",chowning-goodenough1965

The only religious specialist mentioned is the babailan, whose role is described as follows:

“This tribe celebrates no fiestas with the exception of that of [552] sangbay, the same as is observed by the Apurahuanos. This takes place in April. The celebration of the fiesta is the same as by the Apurahuanos with the difference that all classes of diversions and dancing are permitted and in them men, women, and children participate. Neither do they observe the sacrifice of the chicken as the Apurahuanos do. The Batacs, however, construct two little huts in imitation of a house. In the one house is placed palay, in the other are imitation houses of bees made of the leaves of the balasbas or species of palm. The babailan will then recite the prayers and earnestly beseech Diwata that he give to the tribe a year of much palay and bees … The celebration of this feast takes place in the solitary places of the woods, distant from the beach two or three kilometers. 

""When one of the people becomes ill the babailan officiates in the same manner as among the Apurahuanos."" (Venturello, 1907, pp. 551-552)",venturello-1907

""The hereditary titles were those of the two High Priests of Rongo, the Ruler of Food, and the tribal priests. An acquired title was that of Temporal Lord of Mangaia. Chiefs were also appointed to. rule over subdistricts (tapere) and districts (puna). Gill refers to the priests of Rongo as the ‘King defending the Interior’ and the ‘King defending the Shore.’ But as their functions were purely religious, the holders of the title may be more appropriately termed ‘high priests.’ Gill refers to the holder of the temporal power as Temporal Lord of Mangaia, which expresses the position, though he was more nearly a king than were the high priests."" (Buck, 1934, p 112)

The High Priests of Rongo:

“The High Priest of Rongo who officiated on the inland marae was termed the ariki-pa-uta (high-chief-guarding-the-interior). The term pa-uta applies to his supposed function of guarding (pa) the island, by means of chants, from evil spirits that approached from the east. The marae where he officiated was inland (uta), as contrasted with that of the other high priest, which was on the western shore (tai).” (Buck, 1934, p 112)

“The first priest, Rangi, must have installed himself. Later installations were made by the Temporal Lord of Mangaia, who seated the newly inducted priest on the sacred block of sandstone (ke'a) placed in the coastal marae of Orongo. The installation made the officeholder one of the two official priests of Rongo (pi'a atua no Rongo). In preparation for this office, the priest was taught the incantations (karakia) that had been originally given by Rongo to Te Akatauira. His main duties were in connection with the sacrifices to Rongo, which took their most complicated form in the sacrifice after a victory … The observance of the proper ritual placated Rongo and made the reign of the Temporal Lord a successful one. The refusal of the high priest to conduct the ritual led to the venting of Rongo's anger upon the land … The sanctity of the high priest held so long as he restricted himself to his religious duties. If he interfered too much in temporal matters, he forfeited the immunity otherwise enjoyed … Though the title of high priest ran in direct succession from father to son, the Temporal Lord acquired such power that he could influence the succession by having it bestowed upon some other member of the family.” (Buck, 1934, pp 113-114)

“The Shore High Priest ranked second to the Inland High Priest. While exercising his office, his person was extremely sacred … When war broke out, however, the power of the warrior became supreme, and the sacred nature of his office did not protect the Shore High Priest's life if he interfered in temporal matters.” (Buck, 1934, pp 116-117)

The ‘Ruler of Food’:

“The full title of the Ruler of Food is te ariki i te ua i te tapora kai (the high chief presiding at the head of the food baskets). Gill translates the title freely as ‘Ruler of Food’, which suits the office.” (Buck, 1934, p 117)

“The fertility of the land and trees was held to depend on the distribution of the portions of the human sacrifice divided among the ruling chiefs at the ceremony held on the Orongo marae. In olden times the Ruler of Food had some influence as to the imposing of closed seasons (ra'ui) over districts and fishing grounds in order to let depleted food supplies recover. In times of peace, he exercised a ceremonial control over the distribution of food at public feasts. The food was really divided into the required allotments by the local chiefs responsible for the feast, and the public calling of the shares was then made by the Ruler of Food … The correct observance of ceremonial added to the importance of the feast and was associated with continued prosperity. The hereditary title was treated with great respect during peace, and even the change in Temporal Lords did not affect the position so long as the office-page holder and his tribe were not involved in war. During war times the Ruler of Food superintended the provisioning of the troops of his own tribe.” (Buck, 1934, pp 118-119)

Tribal priests:

“The power of the priests of the tribal gods was confined solely within the tribe which served the particular god.” (Buck, 1934, p 119)

The temporal lord:

“The supreme temporal power (mangaia) was held, not by a hereditary successor, but by the leader supreme on the field of battle who became what Gill (12, p. 308) terms ‘victor and consequent real “Lord of Mangaia.”’ (Buck, 1934, p 122)

“On the termination of a campaign the lands of the conquered were forfeited to the victors. The Temporal Lord was thus enabled to reward the leading warriors who had supported him by giving them positions of authority over districts and subdistricts … In the earlier period of Mangaian society the conquerors simply took the lands of the conquered. The development of ceremonial, however, necessitated the public naming of the various officeholders during the installation of the Temporal Lord on the marae.” (Buck, 1934, p 123)

“The Temporal Lord made a visit of state to any district where trouble was brewing. After the feast in his honor, he exhorted the local chief to support his rule by preserving peace.  … The maintenance of peace was of paramount importance to the ruling Temporal Lord, for with the shedding of blood his reign automatically ended.” (Buck, 1934, pp 123-124)

District and subdistrict chiefs:

“During the reign of Pangemiro the island divided into six districts (puna). At the installation of the Temporal Lord, the district chiefs (pava) were appointed from among the successful warriors … The districts were divided up into five to ten subdistricts (tapere), each of which was ruled over by a subdistrict chief. There was no area of land specifically associated with the office of pava. Theoretically, the Temporal Lord selected the six pava, and each pava selected the chiefs to rule over the subdistricts under him … Each subdistrict had its name and was governed by a chief, whose title, kairanga-nuku … signified that the chief ate of the produce of the land in the subdistrict and also that the people ate through him. He saw to the distribution of the taro lands within the subdistrict … He helped to readjust distribution on the death of landholders and settled disputes with regard to lands. An injured person could appeal to the pava.” (Buck, 1934, p 124)",buck1934[112-125]

After the feast in his honor, he exhorted the local chief to support his rule by preserving peace.  … The maintenance of peace was of paramount importance to the ruling Temporal Lord, for with the shedding of blood his reign automatically ended.” (Buck, 1934, pp 123-124)

District and subdistrict chiefs:

“During the reign of Pangemiro the island divided into six districts (puna). At the installation of the Temporal Lord, the district chiefs (pava) were appointed from among the successful warriors … The districts were divided up into five to ten subdistricts (tapere), each of which was ruled over by a subdistrict chief. There was no area of land specifically associated with the office of pava. Theoretically, the Temporal Lord selected the six pava, and each pava selected the chiefs to rule over the subdistricts under him … Each subdistrict had its name and was governed by a chief, whose title, kairanga-nuku … signified that the chief ate of the produce of the land in the subdistrict and also that the people ate through him. He saw to the distribution of the taro lands within the subdistrict … He helped to readjust distribution on the death of landholders and settled disputes with regard to lands. An injured person could appeal to the pava.” (Buck, 1934, p 124)",buck1934[112-125]

""The hereditary titles were those of the two High Priests of Rongo, the Ruler of Food, and the tribal priests. An acquired title was that of Temporal Lord of Mangaia. Chiefs were also appointed to. rule over subdistricts (tapere) and districts (puna). Gill refers to the priests of Rongo as the ‘King defending the Interior’ and the ‘King defending the Shore.’ But as their functions were purely religious, the holders of the title may be more appropriately termed ‘high priests.’ Gill refers to the holder of the temporal power as Temporal Lord of Mangaia, which expresses the position, though he was more nearly a king than were the high priests."" (Buck, 1934, p 112)

The High Priests of Rongo:

“The High Priest of Rongo who officiated on the inland marae was termed the ariki-pa-uta (high-chief-guarding-the-interior). The term pa-uta applies to his supposed function of guarding (pa) the island, by means of chants, from evil spirits that approached from the east. The marae where he officiated was inland (uta), as contrasted with that of the other high priest, which was on the western shore (tai).” (Buck, 1934, p 112)

“The first priest, Rangi, must have installed himself. Later installations were made by the Temporal Lord of Mangaia, who seated the newly inducted priest on the sacred block of sandstone (ke'a) placed in the coastal marae of Orongo. The installation made the officeholder one of the two official priests of Rongo (pi'a atua no Rongo). In preparation for this office, the priest was taught the incantations (karakia) that had been originally given by Rongo to Te Akatauira. His main duties were in connection with the sacrifices to Rongo, which took their most complicated form in the sacrifice after a victory … The observance of the proper ritual placated Rongo and made the reign of the Temporal Lord a successful one. The refusal of the high priest to conduct the ritual led to the venting of Rongo's anger upon the land … The sanctity of the high priest held so long as he restricted himself to his religious duties. If he interfered too much in temporal matters, he forfeited the immunity otherwise enjoyed … Though the title of high priest ran in direct succession from father to son, the Temporal Lord acquired such power that he could influence the succession by having it bestowed upon some other member of the family.” (Buck, 1934, pp 113-114)

“The Shore High Priest ranked second to the Inland High Priest. While exercising his office, his person was extremely sacred … When war broke out, however, the power of the warrior became supreme, and the sacred nature of his office did not protect the Shore High Priest's life if he interfered in temporal matters.” (Buck, 1934, pp 116-117)

The ‘Ruler of Food’:

“The full title of the Ruler of Food is te ariki i te ua i te tapora kai (the high chief presiding at the head of the food baskets). Gill translates the title freely as ‘Ruler of Food’, which suits the office.” (Buck, 1934, p 117)

“The fertility of the land and trees was held to depend on the distribution of the portions of the human sacrifice divided among the ruling chiefs at the ceremony held on the Orongo marae. In olden times the Ruler of Food had some influence as to the imposing of closed seasons (ra'ui) over districts and fishing grounds in order to let depleted food supplies recover. In times of peace, he exercised a ceremonial control over the distribution of food at public feasts. The food was really divided into the required allotments by the local chiefs responsible for the feast, and the public calling of the shares was then made by the Ruler of Food … The correct observance of ceremonial added to the importance of the feast and was associated with continued prosperity. The hereditary title was treated with great respect during peace, and even the change in Temporal Lords did not affect the position so long as the office-page holder and his tribe were not involved in war. During war times the Ruler of Food superintended the provisioning of the troops of his own tribe.” (Buck, 1934, pp 118-119)

Tribal priests:

“The power of the priests of the tribal gods was confined solely within the tribe which served the particular god.” (Buck, 1934, p 119)

The temporal lord:

“The supreme temporal power (mangaia) was held, not by a hereditary successor, but by the leader supreme on the field of battle who became what Gill (12, p. 308) terms ‘victor and consequent real “Lord of Mangaia.”’ (Buck, 1934, p 122)

“On the termination of a campaign the lands of the conquered were forfeited to the victors. The Temporal Lord was thus enabled to reward the leading warriors who had supported him by giving them positions of authority over districts and subdistricts … In the earlier period of Mangaian society the conquerors simply took the lands of the conquered. The development of ceremonial, however, necessitated the public naming of the various officeholders during the installation of the Temporal Lord on the marae.” (Buck, 1934, p 123)

“The Temporal Lord made a visit of state to any district where trouble was brewing. After the feast in his honor, he exhorted the local chief to support his rule by preserving peace.  … The maintenance of peace was of paramount importance to the ruling Temporal Lord, for with the shedding of blood his reign automatically ended.” (Buck, 1934, pp 123-124)

“During the reign of Pangemiro the island divided into six districts (puna). At the installation of the Temporal Lord, the district chiefs (pava) were appointed from among the successful warriors … The districts were divided up into five to ten subdistricts (tapere), each of which was ruled over by a subdistrict chief.

He saw to the distribution of the taro lands within the subdistrict … He helped to readjust distribution on the death of landholders and settled disputes with regard to lands. An injured person could appeal to the pava.” (Buck, 1934, p 124)",buck1934[112-125]

Through the conquest of Taku, Apeiti became ruler over the whole island of Mangareva, but his influence extended over the other islands as well. Except for the break caused by the commoner, Teiti-a-tuou, the descendants of Ruaga ruled as 'akariki until the arrival of the missionaries in 1834.

“The heir to the ‘akariki title had to be born on the marae of Te Kehika, and the mother was accordingly conveyed there when labor pains began … On the eight day the child underwent the igogo ceremony on the marae, and the high priest fed him to bring him under the direct protection of the gods … The king was enveloped in a personal tapu due to his birth. The tapu of priests, on the other hand, was derived from their initiation as a medium of the gods. According to Laval … the king who had the secular tapu alone was termed a kuare but some few were also charged with the sacred tapu and thus had a dual power expressed by the term taura-ariki (priest and king). The sacred tapu, however, was usually conferred on some other member of the royal family who was selected to function as high priest (taura-tupua).” "" (Buck, 1938, pp 151-152)",buck1938[151-152]

“Group leadership in the precolonial Marovo polity of headhunting coastal people was concentrated in the three important institutionalized positions of bangara, varane, and chiama, each of which was normally found in every corporate bububutu. The first and highest-ranking was the largely hereditary position of leader (bangara) of ‘group politics’ or binangara. The bangara held the important ancestral skulls and shell valuables of the butubutu, regulated the use of and access to the ancestral territory, kept genealogical information, organized feasts and other important ceremonial activities, as well as the manufacture and exchange of clamshell valuables, and was the most powerful among the ‘important men’ (palabatu) of his group … Each bangara had as his functionary one or more leading warriors (varane, literally ‘brave, warriorlike’’), whose responsibility was to organize and lead warriors of the butubutu (including temporary associates) in raiding, feuding, and warfare … A chiama (head priest) was likewise attached to each bangara. His job was to organize religious ceremonies and to mediate between the bangara and the spirit world on behalf of the butubutu. One of the main tasks of chiama was to secure tinamanae (foreseeable bestowal of efficacy – a causative noun construct based on mana) for the butubutu’s actities, largely through sacrifices to, and divinatory communication with, ancestral spirits (poda). Although bangara and other influential persons … could perform minor sacrifices and communicate with ancestral spirits at lesser shrines, chiama had overall responsibility for ceremonial activity at major shrines such as the oru where skulls of former bangara are kept and where human sacrifice was performed.” (Hviding, 1996, pp 86-87)

Most 'corporate butubutu' appear to have been localised in one village, though some were larger:

""Clearly, the land and sea terror- [155] ries of Marovo are not controlled by village groups as such. Rather, primary control is in the hands of the resident butubutu core, who constitute the majority of any village population, and who act on behalf of the entire butubutu. The butubutu, not the village, acts as the corporate group … Larger butubutu may have two or more villages within the puava …  as a result of ancient or more recent splits of localized groups because of enmity or, more often, overpopulation. The existence of more than one village may also result from the establishment earlier in the twentieth century of two different missions in the area of one butubutu, in which case fission may be more complete.""

Most religious rituals at the group level appear to have been led by priests (tohunga), though there were some rituals than only chiefs (who were rarely tohunga) could perform. Buck strongly implies that the highest-level priests operated at the 'tribal' level.

“THE GODS HAD HUMAN MEDIUMS OR INTERPRETERS, FOR without such mediums they could not exist … When a god manifested himself through some creature, the creature was termed an aria; but when a deity expressed himself through a human being, that person was termed a waka atua. The term waka atua means literally a ‘canoe of the god’, but it was used figuratively to indicate that the person was regarded as the human receptacle or medium of the god. It implies further that the god could enter or take possession of the human medium to express himself directly to his followers ... In New Zealand, possession was confined to the mediums of the minor gods ...[474] ...The mediums of the gods were termed tohunga, probably derived from the verb tohu, to guide or to direct. However, tohunga was applied to experts in any branch of knowledge, and a qualifying term was necessary at times to distinguish them. The expert carver was a tohunga whakairo (whakairo, to carve) and the tattooing artist was a tohunga ta moko (ta moko, to tattoo). The experts in religious theory and ritual were graded according to the class of god they served. Best (15, p. 166) listed 10 priestly titles derived from various sources. The highest class of priests were termed tohunga ahurewa or tohunga taua; and the lowest, who exploited their fellows through fear, were termed tohunga kehua or tohunga kiato. The tohunga matakite foretold the future, the tohunga tatai arorangi or tohunga kokorangi read the stars, and the tohunga makutu or tohunga whaiwhaia slew people by black magic.” (Buck, 1952, pp. 473-474)

“First-born chiefs inherited certain religious powers (mana atua) by reason of primogeniture. In youth, they were admitted to the schools of learning together with theological students and thus acquired a good deal of religious theory and practice. However, they rarely practised professionally as priests, but there were some rites which could be performed [476] only by them because of their birth. Such was the opening of the sacred oven of the first-born during the ceremony following exhumation.

“The office of tohunga was not strictly hereditary in New Zealand, though, as in other expert professions, a son usually followed in his father's steps. The priests of the departmental and tribal gods were educated men who occupied a responsible position in public life and were often of high birth. Priests of the family gods were usually self-taught and self-created. Those who practised black magic were detested and condemned by public opinion, but they were also feared because of their credited power to slay those who displeased them. As in other walks of life, the social position could be improved by brains and personality.

“Making all due allowance for quacks, who are present in every race, the tohunga constituted a superior class. Though they may have used ventriloquism, hypnotism, possession, and other aids to impress the people with the belief that they had super-normal powers, they used their power wisely in helping the chiefs to govern the people aright. They were the repository of tribal lore regarding myths and tribal history, and they were expert genealogists. They studied natural phenomena and learned much regarding the stars, the seasons, and weather conditions and acquired other information of practical value to the people. Religion was so interwoven with social and material matters that the priests were absolutely necessary to the proper functioning of Maori society. Thus the high-class tohunga were scholars, scientists, and philosophers as well as theologians.” (Buck, 1952, pp. 475-476)

The tribe (iwi), as described by Buck, was clearly a supralocal entity:

“The smallest social unit is the biological family, which the Maori termed whanau, derived from whanau, to give birth. With each generation, the number of families increased and reached such numbers that the restricted term of whanau could no longer be applied to the group. The term hapu (pregnancy) was used to denote this expanded family group for it expressed the idea of birth from common ancestors and thus stressed the blood tie which united the families for the purpose of co-operation in active operations and in defence. If all went well, the hapu expanded still further in succeeding generations making it necessary for groups to separate from the original settlement and take up land in neighbouring localities. Thus the original hapu expanded into a number of hapu, but, as numbers were important in the frequent wars which took place, the hapu still recognized their common blood descent and united when occasion arose. The term iwi (bone) was brought into current use to include all the hapu descended from common ancestors and thus related to each other by a blood tie. To denote the groupings in English, the iwi has been termed tribe and the hapu a sub-tribe.

[334]

“Some sub-tribes remained restricted in numbers or even disappeared through ill fortune in war and other sub-tribes expanded so much that they assumed the status of a tribe and split into sub-tribes. Hence, the descendants of an original pair of ancestors became, in time, grouped into a number of tribes, each with its own sub-tribes. The connecting tie between sub-tribes was close and strong, and, though quarrels broke out between them, they were always ready to combine under tribal leadership for co-operation in tribal affairs. The tie between tribes descended from common ancestors was not so strong but it was recognized and served to bind them together loosely in a form of tribal federation. Such tribes often fought bitter wars between themselves but would unite against outside tribes for common defence or aggression. A similar sentiment would often unite tribes whose ancestors belonged to different families but who came in the same voyaging canoe. The claim for co-operation was the waka, or ancestral canoe, and an eloquent orator could arouse sentiment to the point of action.” (Buck, 1952, pp. 333-334)

(NOTE: In recent years the 'tribal' model of Maori political organisation has been completely overturned (Ballara, 1998). Maori are now seen as having lived in independent hapu or groups of hapu under a ruling chief, which could consist of multiple settlements but were always smaller than an iwi. Unfortunately, Ballara says very little about religious authority.)","buck1952[333-334, 473-477];ballara-1998"

Buck sees priests as being less powerful in New Zealand vis-a-vis chiefs than elsewhere in Polynesia:

“One Tahitian rite has been described at some length to indicate the great development which took place in central Polynesia as compared with the simple rites of New Zealand. This development was due to the growth in power of the priestly class … The prestige of the temple was further heightened by the ruling chief and his colleagues undergoing the menial task of weeding it … It was the large number of minor gods with priestly and lay guardians [507] which made possible such an impressive ceremony as the procession of gods from the marae house to the high altar. The richer food supplies of pigs and turtles and the greater variety and abundance of vegetables enabled the priests to demand a greater quantity of offerings than was possible in New Zealand. However, the feast on the religious marae of Tahiti was the counterpart of the feast on the social marae of New Zealand. Apart, however, from the greater variety of food, a difference existed in that the Tahitian feast had become religious, with the priests directing the distribution of food, whereas the Maori ceremony had remained purely social, with the temporal chiefs retaining their right to distribute and announce the shares of food. The Maori religious rites retained their original simplicity with the chiefs also retaining their full rights in temporal matters, but the Tahitian rites underwent marked elaboration through the growth of priestly power which made successful incursions into the secular authority of temporal chiefs.” (Buck, 1952, pp. 506-507)","buck1952[473-477, 506-507]"

'Social organization' (Scott, 1994, pp. 127-146)

The only religious specialists mentioned are babablyan (shamans or spirit mediums). The religious role of the datu (chief) appears to have been minimal, though he is described as 'sponsoring' sacrifices. The babalyan had authority in the sense that only he or she could perform certain sacrifices. Since the datu was the 'head of the community', the babalyan was presumably his subject.

""Part of ordinary river traffic were little rafts – or, in the case of community sacrifices, large ones – headed downstream bearing the offerings and paraphernalia of ceremonies celebrated along their banks.

""Paganito were basically seances – that is, ceremonies in which a medium established audible communication with spirits … Minor paganito … could be performed by any householder … But solemn paganito had to be conducted by a babaylan. 
Babaylan were shamans or spirit mediums, given to seizures and trances in which they spoke with the voice of diwata and other spirits and acted out conflicts in the spirit world … They came to their calling through attacks of illness or insanity which could only be cured by accepting the call, and then attached themselves as alabay, apprentices, to some older babaylan, frequently a relative. Their renumeration was a designated share of the offerings, usually choice cuts of the hog or the head. But in full-scale paganito sponsored by prominent datus, they went home with heirloom valuables like porcelain plates or gold ornaments … This worship took place in private homes or fields; at grave sites or sacred spots outside the community; or along beaches or streams where little rafts could be launched, aboard which were disease and bad luck, or live pests like locusts or rats. There were no temples, though there were little platforms or sheds at the entrance to the village where offerings were made. Some paganito were for the benefit of individuals or kindred, some were by nature seasonal, and some sought relief from a public crisis like drought or pestilence."" (Scott, 1994, p. 84)

The only religious specialists mentioned are babablyan (shamans or spirit mediums). The religious role of the datu (chief) appears to have been minimal, though he is described as 'sponsoring' sacrifices. The babalyan had authority in the sense that only he or she could perform certain sacrifices. The largest of these appear to have been on a 'community' or 'village' scale:

""Part of ordinary river traffic were little rafts – or, in the case of community sacrifices, large ones – headed downstream bearing the offerings and paraphernalia of ceremonies celebrated along their banks. As for spirits dwelling in the mountains, hunters were sure to offer their first catch to them."" (Scott, 1994, p. 78)

Chiefs in these islands did not hold quite the same position of veneration as in Polynesian islands generally. Though the headman might be a 'great man', and the chief the 'ruler', his position might be surpassed by that of the tangata tapu, the sacred man."" (Capell, 1958, p 4)

""There were priests and priestesses, but the bulk of their work clearly comes within the sphere of magic. Certain ceremonies took place at the fare riki which involved the supernatural a'tua of the various districts or occupations, others took place anywhere and at any time with magical aims."" (Capell, 1958, pp 45-46)

""First, then, the people who exercised priestly power were the a fa'kau no 'hmori, the 'spell-ers' or 'praying people', also called fa'kau 'tapu (singular 'tangata 'tapu) ... The evidence as to whether chiefs were or were not also sorcerers is conflicting. Dr. Paton speaks of 'A Sacred Man, a Chief who had been on Tanna', but Dr. Gunn writes to me in a letter 'The teriki were not necessarily a 'tangata tapu. The sacred men might be ordinary as regards rank, but their craft was generally hereditary ... Popoina, one of the teachers, was a priest in heathenism and also a teriki. This, I think was not general; at least I don't remember any who was in such a high position as Popoina'.

""This is very important. Williamson in his 'Social Organisation of Central Polynesia' sought to establish for Polynesia the general proposition that 'chiefs ... were ex officio priests of their groups' (see Vol. II, p. 406). For Futuna and Aniwa that is emphatically not the case. The meeting of the chieftainship and priesthood in one person was clearly just a coincidence."" (Capell, 1958, p 46)

""Only one full example of the actual ceremonial of worship in the fare riki is preserved by Dr. Gunn; it is the ceremony observed during the flying-fish season, from October to March. 
In it:

""1. The performers were priest, chiefs, commoners, and two young sacred girls.

""2. The priest prayed to the a'tua in control of flying-fish.

""3. He then presented a fish to it. Such a fish would be a small one, not much loss to the fishermen!"" (Capell, 1958, p 50)

The religion of Mare centred on magical objects called kaze. The right to make and use these objects belonged to certain clans called aca-nia. The whole island appears to have acknowledged the same aca-nia clans, and these clans could serve any chiefdom in exchange for payment. The member of an aca-nia clan who handled a kaze was called an aca-kaze. 

« Nous avons défini le kaze maréen. Nous avons vu que le sens primitif était  ‹ mort  ›; que ce terme avait désigné le cadavre-dieu, analogue au bao de Houaïlou; puis qu’il était l’esprit source de vie du clan, devenu à Lifou le haze, Lézard ou Serpent. Nous avons vu que le sens de ‹ mort › s’était conservé dans l’expression ‹ du-re-kaze › = ‹ os de mort ›. Mais ne nom de kaze avait été comme accaparé par les si Xacace, aca-nia des si Hnathege venus de Lifou, qui débarquerent à Hna-te-re-kaz(e) ou Hna-cede-re-kaz(e), sur la côte nord-ouest du Maré. L’introduction du Kaze, pierre [327] servant à fortifier les sorcelleries, est la base d’un cycle mythique très important … En résumé, les si Hathege furent chassés de Lifou, avec leurs aca-nia si Xacace, à une époque difficile à preciser, mais qui, à titre d’hypothèse, pourrait remonter au XVIe siècle. Ceux-ci apportèrent la pierre Kaze qui tirait son pouvoir du culte déclinant de Kong Hulup à Ouvea … Elle servait à fabriquer des sorcelleries de nécromancie, appelées elles-mêmes kaze.

« Les nouveaux arrives séjournèrent quelques temps à Cara, puis les si Hnathege s’installèrent auprés un séjour chez les Aca-kaze auxquels ils donnèrent beaucoup de sorcelleries (d’où leur nom, Maîtres des kaze), se dispersérent. Les chefs s’établirent à La Roche, à la place des si Puhan. Les ‹ derniers-nés › s’entendirent avec les aca-nia si Cohmu, les si Taxeru(e), si Tapep(a). Ils fabriquèrent à Niri, près de Wabao, des kaze qu’ils distribuèrent dans les clans d’acania … Les aca-nia purent augmenter leur puissance jusqu’à dominer le pays et fomenter le massacre de ses anciens maîtres, les Eletok. Le culte des yaac ne signifiait plus grand chose, ne correspondait plus à une grande utilité puisqu’il ne tuait pas les ennemis. Il diminua. L’introduction du Kaze fut une véritable révolution religieuse. » (Dubois, 1984, pp. 326-327)

(""We have defined the Maréan kaze. We have seen that the original sense was 'the dead', that this term had designated the corpose-god, analogous to the bao of Houaïlou; then that it was the spirit of the source of life of the clan, which in Lifou became the haze, Lizard or Serpent. We have seen that the sense of 'the dead' has been preserved in the expression 'du-re-kaze' = 'bone of the dead'. But the name of kaze has been monopolised by the Si Xacace, aca-nia of the si Hnathege who came from Lifou, who disembarked at Hna-te-re-kaz(e) or Hna-cede-re-kaz(e), on the northwest coast of Maré. The introduction of kaze, the use of stones of fortify sorcery, is the basis of a very important mythic cycle ... In brief, the si Hathege were driven from Lifou, with their aca-nia si Xacace, at a time that is difficult to specify, but which, as a hypothesis, may date back to the 16th century. They brought the Kaze stone which drew its power from the declining cult of Kong Hulup at Ouvea ... It was used to make objects that could be used in necromantic sorcery, which were themselves called kaze.

""The new arrivals stayed for some time at Cara, then the si Hnathege settled down among the Aca-kaze, to whom they gave many objects that could be used in sorcery (hence their name, 'Masters of the kaze'), then dispersed.

At Niri, near Wabao, they made kaze that they distributed among the aca-nia clans ... The aca-nia were able to icnrease their power to dominate the country and foment the massacre of their old masters, the Eletok. The cult of yaac no longer meant much, it was no longer useful since it did not kill enemies. It diminished. The introduction of Kaze was a true religious revolution."")

« Pour fabriquer un kaze, il fallait être membre d’un clan d’aca-nia détenteur d’un waceng special. Le sorcier tenait ce pouvoir de sa parenté ascendante, et l’avait reçu par la cérémonie du crachement de la salive dans la bouche et dans les mains. » (Dubois, 1984, p. 327)

(""To make a kaze, it was necessary to belong to an aca-nia clan possessing a special waceng [magical object. The sorcerer got his power from his ancestors, and received it through the ceremony of spitting saliva in the mouth and in the hands."")

« La force du kaze éprouvée, le clan des aca-nia se réunissait sous la présidence de son chef et discuitait pour savoir à qui on allait le donner. Décision prise, on cédait la sorcellerie à telle chefferie moyennant des richesses indigènes. Un member du clan des aca-nia était chargé de la garde du paquet magique au profit du chef demandeur. Telle est la principale raison donnée par Alexandre Alan pour la dispersion des clans d’aca-nia, en particulier du sien, celui des si Tapep(a). » (Dubois, 1984, p. 329)

(“The strength of the kaze having been tested, the aca-nia clan met under the leadership of its chief and discussed to whom it was to be given. The decision having been made, the kaze was granted to a given chiefdom in return for indigenous wealth.

This was the main reason given by Alexander Alan for the dispersal of the aca-nia clans, in particular his own, the si Tapep(a).”)

« Le manipulateur d’un kaze était un aca-kaze. Le chef au profit duquel était manipulé le kaze, ne l’utilisait pas lui-même. Il se servait de l’intermédaire de l’aca-nia aca-kaze. L’opération risquait de se retourner contre le manipulateur profane. » Dubois, 1984, p. 329)

Maré was divided into 'chiefdoms' (pa-doku), each of which centred on a 'chief' (doku) and consisted of multiple 'clans' (guhnameneng). The role of the doku was largely ceremonial:

« Le clan, la famille élargie, est la cellule de base sociale. Avec la Christianisation, la famille biologique prend de plus en plus d’autonomie. Mais autrefois, l’autorité sur ses membres était le fait des chefs de clan, toka-guhnameneng. Ceux-ci étaient, en principe, les aînes des clans aînes.

« La chefferie, pa-doku, dans l’esprit de gens, est l’extension du clan guhnameneng. En fait, les choses sont plus complexes. Selon le modèle théoretique, un clan autonome guhnameneng devient une chefferie padoku … En réalité, une chefferie est l’association de plusieurs guhnameneng ayant comme centre de cohesion un individu du nom de re-tok ou doku, qui est, théoriquement mais non obligatoirement, l’aîné tok du clan dominant ... [220] ... La traduction française ‹ chef › est un trahison. Le chef maréen n’est pas une ‹ caput ›. Son rôle n’est pas tellement de penser et de commander, boen qu’il le fasse, mais de recevoir les presents remis à la chefferie. » 
(Dubois, 1984, pp. 219-220)

(""The clan, the enlarged family, is the basic social unit. With Christianisation, the biological family gains more and more autonomy. But in the past, authority over its members rested with the clan-chiefs, toka-guhnameneng. These were, in principle, the elders of the eldest clans.

""The chiefdom, pa-doku, in the minds of the people, is an extension of the clan (guhnameneng). In fact, the matter is more complex. In theory, an autonomous clan constitutes a chiefdom. In reality, a chiefdom is an association of many guhnameneng centred on an individual called the re-tok or doku, who is, theoretically but non necessarily, the eldest tok of the dominant clan ... The French translation ‘chief’ is misleading. The Maréan chief is not a ‘caput’. His role is not so much to think and to command, if he does so, but to receive the gifts given to the chiefdom."")

Other leadership roles were allocated to certain clans within the chiefdom:

« Chaque clan avait sa spécialité, cultuire de telle igname, de tel taro, de telle plante alimentaire, la pêche à tel poisson, [233] la fabrication de tel filet, de telle nasse, la construction de pirogue, soigner telle maladie, la possession de tells invisibles, mo-yaac lutins (maica), faire la pluie, le soleil, le brouillard, fair la famine, etc., etc … Si la spécialité exige le concours de toute la population, pêche, guerre, etc., il y a un chef de cette spécialité, qui est toka- (chef de-); toka-ruac = chef de travail, toka-koe = captain de bateau; ou toa = ce qui soutient, toa-eat – chef de guerre. » (Dubois, 1984, pp. 232-233)

(""Each clan has its specialty, cultivation of a given yam, of a given taro, of a given food plant, catching a given fish, making a  given net, a given trap, the construction of canoes, curing a given disease, possession by given invisibles, moy-yaac elves (maica), making rain, sun, fog, famine, etc., etc. ... If the specialty requires the support of the whole population, fishing, war, etc., there is a chief of this specialty, who is toka (chief of-); toka-ruac = chief of work, toka-koe = boat captain; ou toa, he who sustains, toa-eat - war-chief."")

A clan with the title mo-eteshet played some kind of magical role for the chiefdom as a whole:

« Lorsqu’une chefferie se fondait, elle se choisissait des ‹ anciens › mo-eteshet ... Ils gardiant les magies de la Chefferie. » (Dubois, 1984, p. 231)

(""When a chiefdom was founded, it chose 'elders', mo-eteshet ... They kept the magic of the chiefdom."")

However, a group of clans called the aca-nia appear to have been more important. The religion of Maré was based primarily on magical objects called kaze, and the aca-nia had a monopoly on the manufacture and use of these objects:

« Nous avons défini le kaze maréen. Nous avons vu que le sens primitif était  ‹ mort  ›; que ce terme avait désigné le cadavre-dieu, analogue au bao de Houaïlou; puis qu’il était l’esprit source de vie du clan, devenu à Lifou le haze, Lézard ou Serpent.

The whole island appears to have acknowledged the same aca-nia clans, and it would seem that any one of these clans could serve any chiefdom in exchange for payment:

« La force du kaze éprouvée, le clan des aca-nia se réunissait sous la présidence de son chef et discuitait pour savoir à qui on allait le donner.

This was the main reason given by Alexander Alan for the dispersal of the aca-nia clans, in particular his own, the si Tapep(a).”)

The member of the aca-nia who handled the kaze was called an aca-kaze. Dubois notes that the chief on whose behalf the kaze was being employed never handled it himself:

« Le manipulateur d’un kaze était un aca-kaze. Le chef au profit duquel était manipulé le kaze, ne l’utilisait pas lui-même. Il se servait de l’intermédaire de l’aca-nia aca-kaze. L’opération risquait de se retourner contre le manipulateur profane. » Dubois, 1984, p. 329)

(""The handler of a kaze was a called an aca-kaze. The chief for whose benefit the kaze was being manipulated did not use it himself. He used the aca-nia aca-kaze as an intermediary. The operation could backfire on a layman handler."")

More on the relationship between aca-kaze and the chiefs they servied:

« A l’inverse des moeteshet, l’aca-nia est toujours un étranger à la chefferie qu’il sert. La reception d’un kaze entraîne forcément l’envoi d’un gardien et manipulateur de cette magie. Ils s’ensuit que l’aca-nia pouvait avoir une politique différente de celle du chef qu’il était censé server, de là des conflits très violents ... [232] ... Théoretiquement, l’aca-nia aurait le droit de deposer un doku. L’histoire de Maré ne rapporte qu’un seul cas: l’aca-nia si Ahnumi déposa le chef si Hnathege parce qu’il avait mangé le poisson gucakoe, le ‹ rouget de nuit › ... le poisson de l’aca-nia. » (232)

(""Unlike the moeteshet, the aca-nia is always a stranger to the chiefdom that he serves. The reception of a kaze necessarily entails sending a guardian and handler of that magic. It follows that the aca-nia could have very different policies from the chief that he was supposed to serve, hence very violent conflicts ... In theory, the aca-nia had the right to depose a doku. The history of Maré reports only one case: the aca-nia si Ahnumi deposed the chief si Hnathege because he had eaten the gucakoe fish, the 'red mullet' ... the fish of the aca-nia."")","dubois1984[219-262, 287-342]"

The all-purpose medium, the ibonga, does not appear to have had a strong role in Kiribati life. He was quite similar to mediums and religious experts throughout Micronesia."" (Dobbin, 2011, p. 199)

'Precedence and privileges of the clans in the Maneaba' (Grimble & Maude, 1989, pp. 219-230)

“Many clans had hereditary privileges or duties connected with the ceremonial of the maneaba, which they most jealously prized and guarded. Among these, the group of Karongoa n Uea ‘Karongoa of Kings’, as its name suggests, was foremost in rank. Karongoa n Uea was king of the maneaba; at all ceremonial gatherings within the edifice, its chief man—the senior descendant through eldest sons of the original ancestor—assumed ‘the first word and the last word’ in debate … [220] … Attached to Karongoa n Uea was a very clear-cut doctrine of infallibility concerning certain race traditions … [221] … A Gilbertese explanation of the pre-eminence of this clan in the ceremonial of the maneaba is that ‘it is Samoa’; that is to say, it represents the victorious immigration from Samoa into the Gilbert Islands.” (Grimble & Maude, 1989, pp. 219-221)

“Though there can be no doubt that the people of Karongoa n Uea came as conquerors and chiefs to the group, their prestige in the maneaba is now entirely divorced from the idea of temporal power, and their privileges are largely independent of political vicissitudes.

""On Abemama, indeed, where the high chiefs belong to the clan of Kaburara, the insolently despotic Tem Binoka of fifty years ago, whose particular pleasure it was to override all Gilbertese custom and so display his power, became jealous of Karongoa's ceremonial prerogatives and deliberately assumed them to himself. Since then Kaburara has performed on Abemama all the offices in the maneaba that used to be in the hands of Karongoa n Uea …  The deliberate stroke of disorganization which Binoka was obliged to effect on Abemama, in order to rob Karongoa of its precedence, only serves to throw into greater relief the durable character of its privileges, for before their spoliation they had subsisted intact through six successive generations of powerful high chiefs. Their eventual loss for political reasons was quite exceptional, being without parallel on any other Gilbert island. Elsewhere, whatever may have been the accidents of war or other material circumstances, Karongoa remained supreme in the maneaba from the time of the Samoan immigration right up to the coming of the British flag in 1892.” (Grimble, 1989, p. 223)

Karongoa n Uea had the right to perform certain communal ceremonies, but was not the only kin group with this role:

""Each separate Gilbertese totem group, as a rule, practiced the cult of its own ancestral deities independently of all others; but in time of famine, a form of ritual meal was practised. All groups united, with the senior male of Karongoa n Uea as the officiating priest, at a stone pillar representing the body of a being named Tabakea, within a maneaba of a particular style called Maungatabu."" (Grimble, 1989, p. 17)

""The cult of Tabakea approaches nearer to the idea of a tribal cult than any other noted heretofore. On occasions of stress, disease, or necessity, when a group of utu allied for political or warlike purposes felt the approach of common danger, a stone about 6 to 9 feet high would be erected in the maneaba .. The senior man of Karongoa n Uea, the clan in the maneaba whose privilege it was to speak the first and last word in assembly, would decide upon a day when all the utu should be gathered together to make offerings (karea) and prayers (tataro) at the stone."" (Grimble, 1989, p. 81)

“A highly interesting ritual, in which the Sun and the Moon played a large part, was formerly used for the purpose of ensuring a rich pandanus [11] harvest. The ceremony could be performed only by members of three clans, Karongoa, Ababou, and Maerua.” (Grimble & Maude, 1989, pp. 10-11)",dobbin2011[199]

19878,toba-batak,84,3,149-3,"‘Religious Concepts’ (Vergouwen, 1964, pp. 67-104)

‘The Corporate Communities (Haradjaon)’ (Vergouwen, 1964, pp. 105-136)

The Toba Batak lived in villages (huta), more than one of which formed a ‘tribal group’ (marga, though this term was also used for larger and smaller units):

""It is comparatively simple to describe the main features of the smallest of the Batak corporate groups, the village; and the highest, the tribal group. Below the village there is only the hamlet; above the tribal group there is only the Batak people as such. It is what lies between these two extremes that presents the difficulty."" (Vergouwen, 1964, p. 105)

The largest-scale ceremonies appear to have taken place at the level of the ‘tribal group’. Sometimes this coincided with a bius (‘sacrificial community’), but sometimes not. In part of the Toba Batak area, these ceremonies were managed by figures called parbaringan ‘priests of the bius feasts’, who were representatives of a figure called the Singamangaradja, whose influence appears to have transcended any one tribal group or bius. Elsewhere the parbaringan were less influential, and large-scale ceremonies were performed by figures called datu as well as the ‘principal chiefs of the tribal group’: 

“In the ceremony just described the great ancestor is accorded the respect that is his due. But, greater honour still was given to the sumangot if his line had grown to a great marga or tribal group. (Here one must speak in the past tense since Christianity has spread everywhere.) He was then elevated to the highest rank of spirits approaching the status of the gods ; he became the sombaon = he who is revered. Formerly this elevation took place at a great sacrificial ceremony that was specially arranged for the purpose, the santi rea, at which all his descendants and their affines assembled. Henceforth the sombaon would dwell in a holy place, on the summit of a mountain, in a primeval forest, or in a great river. In the Nai Rasaon group, for instance, the dwelling place of the spirit of the tribal ancestor is the Simanukmanuk mountain range that separates Uluan from the East Coast. The sombaon was always invoked at all important religious ceremonies as the principal [72] and most powerful of all the spirits of the patrilineal community. As a rule, his veneration took place at a place permanently assigned for the purpose: sometimes it was the market place of the whole community, sometimes it was elsewhere. The principal chiefs of the lineage met and made the necessary arrangements ... [73] ... The sacrificial feast that was arranged by the bius, or bus ('was' because the Dutch Government forbade these ceremonies many years ago) showed great conformity in its aims and forms with the big sombaon offering-ceremonies. The bius was distinguished from the latter in that it did not embrace a genealogically pure group of agnates (to whose feasts the affines and the chiefs of the neighbourhood were invited as guests), but a larger or smaller geographical area and all its inhabitants. Nevertheless, the genealogical divisions of the groups living within that area were not lost sight of … The bius and its cult had the least significance in areas where the marga, in occupying their ancestral territory, continued to live together as a whole with their separate branches and lineages, each marga having [74] its own corner of the territory. These marga, apart from dispersals, there formed genealogically as well as geographically well-rounded kinship groups. Each could conduct its own hordja, feasts, as occasion demanded for its own territory and if they united, they still always formed a higher group of patrilineally linked kinsmen in one area. Only if, for example, an epidemic ravaged the entire ancestral area or if drought threatened the fields of the inhabitants, would there be recourse to a general assembly of the inhabitants of the very large territory which embraced the tribal group as well as its in-dwelling groups and enclaves. The bius connection there did not have more far-reaching consequences than those resulting from the periodical sacrificial-feasts … In other regions, however, such as Samosir and Uluan, where the marga did not so often occupy their own homogeneous area but where, on the contrary, their divisions were usually dispersed over the whole of the tribal area in large or small groups, the formation of religious groups had acquired a secular significance too … Thus bius were formed which had a mixed religious and secular character. Each bius usually comprised a not too large geographical area and formed a political community of a couple of thousand people in [75] which a common feeling of solidarity outside the sphere of the sacrificial feasts proper had also developed. The objects of veneration in these bius were generally the ancestor common to all, the sombaon, as well as the gods and the nature spirits, and all the forefathers who had lived previously, the ompu sidjolo-djolo tubu, And there was a tendency to gather up these 'small' bius into a very large one which embraced the whole tribal group, or a very large part of it, with the sole object of celebrating the very large and communal sacrificial-ceremonies; for example, the bius 'Hariara maranak' for the whole of South Samosir, or the biu s 'O nan na godang' for the whole of South Uluan and 'Pansur na pitu' for North Uluan.

""It is worthy of note that in areas where the bius acquired this political character paganism has held out the longest. This is not attributable to the fact that worldly and spiritual power were under one control because this has not been the case, except in one or two areas, and then only temporarily. In part it can be ascribed to the influence of Singamangaradja whose most active representatives were always the parbaringin, the priests of the bius feasts. This applied only in the Sumba territory around the south-westerly parts of Lake Toba and not to the Lontung territory of Samosir and its environs where Singamangaradja met nothing but opposition. However, in these Lontung territories, the extensive organisation of officials which the bius brought into existence, and who conducted the more or less important rituals in the offering ceremonies, was also a powerful stronghold of paganism ... The parbaringin-organisation has become the carrier of pagan concepts. In the region where it is operative it almost entirely controls the regular worship and the agricultural ceremonies connected with it, and it has a powerful hold on the thoughts of the ordinary man such as is not to be found elsewhere. Such an organisation does not exist in the south of the Toba Country where the periodical bius feasts were directed by the principal chiefs of the tribal group. The datu co-operated where necessary and the paung na opat, as the representatives of Singamangaradja were sometimes called there, took part, but they remained in the background ... But in areas where the bius was a powerful institution the parbaringin were important people. It was the secular chiefs who decided to hold a bius ceremony, but in most of the [76] bius it was the parbaringin-organisation, which could be very extensive, that almost completely controlled the procedure of the ceremony."" (Vergouwen, 1964, pp. 72-76)

Vergouwen mentions three specifically religious specialists in the chapter of Toba Batak religion: the datu, parbaringin, and Singamangaradja, as well as mentioning that 'secular chiefs' played a religious role in that they were believed to be supernaturally powerful and could decide when to hold religious ceremonies:

""Though the tondi-potential is present in everybody, its supernatural force is neither apparent to everybody nor conspicuously active until a man displays particular qualities. Then its existence comes to light. A man who becomes wealthy, one who has a host of sons and daughters and grandsons, a man who carries on authoritatively the chieftaincy obtained by his forefathers, a courageous man, an eloquent man, all bear witness that their tondi has abundant power of which these desired qualities are a manifestation and, as a result, they have their share of courage, wealth, temporal power, etc., the sahala habeguon, hamoraon, haradjaon, etc. Of particular note are the 'potent ones', people like the datu or the parbaringin: they have been specially initiated into the secrets of magico-religious practices, they know how to arouse this power and how to make it efficacious. For this reason their supernatural power is very potent. This attribute was most marked in the supreme magician, Singamangaradja, who had complete control over these forces and knew how to direct them. The influential chiefs also display it to a remarkable degree. All who exhibit a particular 'power' are always honoured and respected by people as those deserving of respect, na sangap. Honour and respect, hasangapon, are the desirable results of possessing sahala."" (Vergouwen, 1964, p. 83)",vergouwen-1964[67-136]

“According to the island's oral traditions, Tannese society includes three explicitly defined social functions. These functions correspond to three groups of different status involved in separate types of activity; they can also be seen as three images of power. Keeping at the front of the canoe, the yremera is the canoe's ‘honor’ and living emblem. As such, his power—symbolized by the hawk—is linked with great ceremonial exchanges, the sharing of food, and the control of the traditional roads of alliance that allow for these activities. The yani niko or ‘voice of the canoe’ represents political will: keeping at the back of the canoe, he steers it in war times. He has authority over the territory, because he is heir to the ‘first man’ who appeared on it. Indeed, the yani niko keeps land for the others and is in charge of land sharing. His role is to highlight the yremera's glory and to speak on his behalf. Finally, the naotupunus works with agrarian magic: he holds the sacred powers immersed [151] in the canoe's places and is the sanctioned mediator of supernatural forces. As the canoe's belly, he keeps in the middle.

“First comes the honor, second the political will, third the magic. In metaphorical terms, the yremera is the canoe's emblem, the yani niko its helmsman, and the naotopunus its belly. While the tradition of the 'voices of the canoe' (yani niko) originated on the western side of the island, notably in the Ipai area which gave birth to the Semo-Semo myth, the hawk tradition, that of the yremera, gave rise to a second society on the eastern side, in the Ipeukel (Embuitoka) area. The hawk tradition may be linked with the phenomenon of the Polynesian outliers and therefore with a cultural influence from Samoa or Tonga ... With its equality-based ideology and its 'voices of the canoe' as masters of the land, the myth of the nepro corresponds to a very ancient Melanesian tradition. More recent are the symbols of the kweriya (hawk) and the tapa belt (tut) which, along with their honor-based ideology, may have appeared in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries A. D., or perhaps later, two or three hundred years ago. Mwatiktiki, Kasiken's father, is the first Polynesian hero ... These two traditions also differ from the standpoint of the transfer of titles. Within the original lineage of each canoe, clan elders choose the yani niko on the basis of their human and intellectual qualities—their actual title is irrelevant. By contrast, an yremera receives his title as a child: he is neither 'elected' nor chosen but receives his power through the height of his title.” (Bonnemaison, 1994, pp. 150-151)",bonnemaison1994[150-151]

19033,mota,86,2,150-2,"Codrington (1881, p. 287) claims that the Banks Islanders lack ‘all political organisation whatever’:

The great institutions of the Banks' Islands are the Suqe and the Tamate, which in the absence of all political organisation whatever, supply a certain bond of unity and order throughout the group. 

It is not entirely clear why Codrington does not consider these societies to be political, since he describes high positions as conferring considerable ‘authority’:

""The Suqe is a club, the house belonging to which is the most conspicuous building in every village, and is to be found wherever there is a permanent habitation. This house, or gamal, has many compartments, each with its own oven, in accordance with the several grades in the society. Almost all the male population belong to this club, and were formerly bound to take their meals in the gamal, the women and little children alone eating in the houses. To rise from one grade to another money has to be given and pigs killed; to take the highest degrees is very expensive, and requires a certain amount of influence, social, and according to native notions, like all other powers, to some extent supernatural. On this account men seeking the high degrees fast, and perform such rites as that of the Qaranq suqe (suqe-hole) above mentioned. As admission to the highest grades depends on the good will of the few who have already reached them, and all promotion in every rank is consequently under their control, the authority of the men highest in the Suqe is very considerable indeed. It is these persons who appear to traders and naval officers as chiefs. Their position, however, is merely social, but as has been said before, the fact of their having been able to reach such a position, argues in the native mind the possession of mana, which always has some supernatural quality."" (Codrington, 1881, p. 287)

""The members of the great Tamate indulge in much licence. When they choose to go abroad to collect provision for one of their feasts, the women and uninitiated are obliged to keep away from their paths. The warning voice of the Tamate is heard, and the country is shut up. There is also a considerable power in these societies to keep order. Each has its distinguishing leaf of a croton. When a member of any Tamate sets a tapu he will mark it with its leaf, and anyone who violates the tapu will have to do with all of that society. A man who belongs to all, or all the important, tamates will consequently have much power, and the same man will probably, almost certainly, be high also in the Suqe. He will have great personal influence and mana, and he will have the two great institutions of the country at his back. In islands where there is no political or tribal organisation, position in the Suqe and the Tamate makes the ‘Great man,’ whose authority is respected and maintains order. Some years ago men in the highest position in Mota forbade the carrying of bows, in accordance with Bishop Patteson's teaching, and when a man in anger caught up his weapon, the cry of the Tamate was heard all round the district, and the fault had to be atoned for with a pig."" (Codrington, 1881, p. 288)

In ‘The Melanesians’, Codrington (1891) provides an account of the Tamate (pp 75-86) and Suqe society that is consistent with his earlier account. However, he also mentions a figure called the etvusmel or tavusmele (‘chief’), whose role had previously been ‘obscured’ by the power of the Tamate and Suqe. The fact that the etvusmel was always a high-ranking member of the Suqe and the various Tamate societies makes it difficult to ascertain what powers were vested in this office specifically. In any case, the authority of the tavusmele appears to have gone no further than the village:

""At Banks' Islands the Tavusmele or Etvusmel in former days kept order, gave commands about the common concerns of the place, arranged difficulties with neighbouring villages, could order an offender (one for example who had bewitched or poisoned another) to be put to death, or to pay a fine of pigs.""(Codrington, 1891, p. 47)

""The very great part played in the native life of the Banks' Islands by the secret societies hereafter to be described, the Suqe and Tamate, has always obscured the appearance of such power as a chief would be expected to exercise. Any man whose influence was conspicuous was certainly high in these societies, and it would be wholly inconsistent with the social habits of the people that a man whose place in the Suqe was insignificant should have any considerable power. Hence chiefs as such have hardly been recognized by the missionaries engaged in this group, though traders have found chiefs and kings. When Mala many years ago forbade the use of bows, it was taken to be done by the power he had in all the societies [55] in Vanua Lava and Mota. Still there was a name meaning chief, etvusmel, tavusmele, and a native of Motlav who resided some weeks in Florida, in the district where Takua was counted a great chief, bears witness that he saw no great difference between that vunagi and the etvusmel of his own home. The succession of the Etvusmel is declared by him to have been from father to son, as far as can be remembered, an important point to notice where descent in family goes by the mother; and it is said that the chief was always of the great clan or kin, the veve liwoa, an expression which also requires explanation. The explanation is that in practice, as in the devolution of property and in the handing on of religious and magic rites, a man always put as far as he could his son into his own place, and a rich and powerful man would secure a high place in the Suqe for his son in very early years; thus the great man's son would succeed to his place, and become to some extent an hereditary chief. The father and the son would always be of different sides of the house; and, as at Florida the chiefs were generally of the kema which happened to be most numerous at the time, so in the Banks' Islands, where the divisions are but two, and each of them in alternate generations more numerous than the other, the chief man was regularly found on the most powerful side of the house. Thus it can be said that the succession of Etvusmel at Motlav has been from father to son as long as can be remembered, and will so continue, though with lessened consequence. Besides those who were really chiefs many men were called 'great men,' and had considerable influence in their villages, men who had been [56] valiant and successful in war, and were high in the Suqe; that is to say, men who were known to have mana, for a man's charms and amulets made him the great warrior, and his charms and stones made his pigs and yams to multiply, so that he could buy his steps in the society. The cleanliness and order of a Banks' Island village are not now what they were, since the authority of the 'great men' has been diminished by the increasing enlightenment of the young people."" (Codrington, 1891, pp 54-56)

Rivers (1916, pp. 61-144) provides a more detailed discussion of the Tamate and Suqe of the Banks Islands that is largely consistent with Codrington’s description. There are some differences – whereas Codrington described the Tamate and Suque as independent institutions, Rivers notes that membership in the Tamate Liwoa society was necessary to advance beyond a certain grade in the Suqe. 

Altogether, etvusmel is the only position that appears to have corresponded to an office, viz. ‘a standardized set of rights and duties devolving upon a person in certain defined situations’ (Hughes, 1937). The rights and duties appear to have involved keeping order within a village (Codrington, 1891, p. 47). The various grades of the Suqe and Tamate societies do not quite meet this definition. There were rights associated with various ranks – for example, no one below the grade of tavatsukwe could drink kava (Rivers, 1916, pp. 126-127) – but it is not clear that they had any defined duties.",codrington1891[54-56]

19880,trobriand-islands,84,2,149-2,"In his fairly detailed overview of Trobriand society, Malinowski (1922, pp 49-78) mentions two kinds of ritual specialist: the garden magician and the sorcerer.

The garden magician:

""Among the forces and beliefs which bear upon and regulate garden work, perhaps magic is the most important. It is a department of its own, and the garden magician, next to the chief and the sorcerer, is the most important personage of the village. The position is hereditary , and, in each village, a special system magic is handed on in the female line from one generation to another. I have called it a system , because the magician has to perform a series of rites and spells over the garden, which run parallel with the labour, and which, in fact, initiate each stage of the work and each new development of the plant life. Even before any gardening is begun at all, the magician has to consecrate the site with a big ceremonial performance in which all the men of the village take part. This ceremony officially opens the season's gardening, and only after it is performed do the villagers begin to cut the scrub on their plots. Then, in a series of rites, the magician inaugurates successively all the various stages which follow one another--the burning of the scrub, the clearing, the planting, the weeding and the harvesting."" (Malinowski, 1922, p 59)

""Again, within each district, the several village communities have each a great deal of independence. A village community is represented by a headman, its members make their gardens in one block and under the guidance of their own garden magician; they carry on their own feasts and ceremonial arrangements, mourn their dead in common, and perform, in remembrance of their departed ones, an endless series of food distributions. In all big affairs, whether of the district or of the tribe, members of a village community keep together, and act in one group."" (Malinowski, 1922, p 70)

The sorcerer:

""One point in connection with the chief's authority deserves special mention. Power implies not only the possibility of rewarding, but also the means of punishing. This in the Trobriands is as a rule done indirectly, by means of sorcery. The chief has the best sorcerers of the district always at his beck and call. Of course he also has to reward them when they do him a service. If anyone offends him, or trespasses upon his authority, the chief summons the sorcerer, and orders that the culprit shall die by black magic. And here the chief is powerfully helped in achieving his end by the fact that he can do this openly, so that everybody, and the victim himself knows that a sorcerer is after him."" (Malinowski, 1922, p. 64)

""By far the most prevalent form of black magic, is that of the bwaga'u, that is the black sorcerer, of whom there are a number in each district. Usually even in each village there are one or two men more or less dreaded as bwaga'u."" (Malinowski, 1922, p 73)

Based on the excerpts above, the role of garden magician was clearly an office at the village level. Sorcery appears to have been a profession rather than an office, and in any case does not appear to have been linked to any defined group. 

Elsewhere, Malinowski makes it clear that the position of towosi (garden magician) was the prerogative of the ‘chief’, though often he delegated it to a close relative. 

""The towosi or garden magician is an hereditary official of every village community. As a matter of fact, the position of towosi coincides with that of the Chief or the head-man, if not in identity of person, at least in the principle of lineage. In native mythology and legal theory, it is always the head of the kinship group owning a village who is the garden magician. This man, however, frequently delegates his duties to his younger brother, his matrilineal nephew, or his son. Such handing over of the office of garden magician was especially frequent in the lineage of the paramount chiefs of Omarakana, on whom the duties of charming the gardens weighed too heavily."" (Malinowski, 1922, p 64)

Although garden magic was clearly a village-level affair, the weather magic (tourikuna) wielded by the chief of Omarakana was feared throughout Kiriwina, and perhaps even further. However, while the chief of Omarakana had rights stemming from his control of this magic, it is not clear that he had any duties. Hence based on Hughes' (1937) definition of an office ('a standardized set of rights and duties devolving upon a person in certain defined situations'), this was not an office.

""The most important chief is, as said, the one who resides in Omarakana and rules Kiriwina, agriculturally the richest and most important district. His family, or sub-clan, the Tabalu, are acknowledged to have by far the highest rank in all the Archipelago. Their fame is spread over the whole Kula district; the entire province of Kiriwina derives prestige from its chief, and its inhabitants also keep all his personal taboos, which is a duty but also a distinction. Next to the high chief, there resides in a village some two miles distant, a personage who, though in several respects his vassal, is also his main foe and rival, the headman of Kabwaku, and ruler of the province of Tilataula. The present holder of this title is an old rogue named Moliasi. From time to time, in the old days, war used to break out between the two provinces, each of which could muster some twelve villages for the fight."" (Malinowski, 1922, p. 66)

""A brief outline of chieftainship must therefore be rather rough and ready and cannot do justice to the complexity of the subject. Take for instance the unquestionably paramount chief of Omarakana in his relation to his military rival, the chief of the province of Tilataula, resident at Kabwaku. The paramount chief has the higher rank. He is the wielder of the rain and sunshine magic; that is, master of tribal fertility. His personal prestige, the aura of power and dignity around him, are incomparably higher and more august. At the same time, he could be beaten and driven out of his home on occasions by his rival."" (Malinowski, 1935, p 38)

""Over and above individual effort, there is the power of towosi magic, the ordinary garden magic of the community; the influence of vilamalia, the magic of prosperity, and last but not least, the supreme magical power of the paramount chief, tourikuna. This magic finally decides on excessive sunshine, which means drought, or the adequate rainfall, which brings fertility to the islands."" (Malinowski, 1935, p 83)

There was also a 'traditional center of astronomical knowledge', the village of Wawela, which set the timing of the Milamala festival for the whole of Kiriwina. Not clear that this position involved rights and duties, however, rather than simply expertise.

“In the southern part of Boyowa, there is first the province of Luba, occupying the waist of the island, the part where it narrows down to a long isthmus. This part is ruled by a chief of high rank, who resides in Olivilevi ... Wawela, which was formerly a very big village, now consists of hardly more than twenty huts. The only one on the Eastern shore which lies right on the sea, it is very picturesquely situated, overlooking a wide bay with a clean beach. It is of importance as the traditional centre of astronomical knowledge. From here, for generation after generation up to the present day, the calendar of the natives has been regulated. This means that some of the most important dates are fixed, especially that of the great annual festival, the Milamala, always held at full moon.” (Malinowski, 1922, p. 68)",malone2006[49-78]

""'""For more than four months I was almost daily an observer of the religious ceremonies of the Wallis Islanders. As soon as day began to break, Vong Ouvie and myself repaired to the temple, where the natives devote two hours of every morning to their public worship ... Against the partition sat the king and priestess. On the right side sat the chiefs of the island and my companions of the Gilde. The priest seaten me with himself on the left. The remaining space was occupied by the natives generally ... [89] ... The priestess of the island, who resided in an apartment of the Avahlu, was, to appearance, about 40 years of age and of moderate personal comeliness. She was much respected by the natives, who regarded her sayings as oracular."" (Burrows, 1937, pp. 88-89)","burrows-1937[6-7, 76, 4-91]"

21242,tanimbar,85,2,151-2,"‘The community nobles’ (McKinnon, 1991, pp. 73-79)

“Presently, as in the past, it is only in situations in which the village faced outward that its identity as a unit becomes manifest. These situations include primarily those of warfare and intervillage brotherhood alliance renewals, but also epidemics and, in some villages, agricultural rituals. It is on the stone boat that the ceremonies proper to these events are carried out by the ritual officials of the village. By contrast, all matters internal to the village – involving marriage, sickness (except epidemics), death, adultery, theft, and the like – are handled along the lines of authority demarcated by houses, marriage alliance and exchange pathways, or occasionally, by church and governmental structures.” (McKinnon, 1991, p. 71)

“Tanimbarese currently recognize two sets of village leaders. Those who belong to the indigenous religio-political order are called the ‘land-side nobles’ (mela raa). They are distinguished from those called the ‘sea-side nobles’ (mela roal), who were appointed by a succession of external authorities – the Dutch East India Company, the Dutch colonial government, and the Indonesian government … The landside nobles are also called the ‘community nobles’ (mel kubania). Although, paradoxically, the term kubania derves from the Dutch word compagnie, which was used in the Moluccas to refer to the Dutch East India Company, it is clear that the Tanimbarese ritual offices known as the community nobles do not owe their origin to the Dutch East India Company. In Tanimbar, the Dutch origin of the word kubania is not known … Although villages differ a bit in the ritual offices they recognize, nevertheless, throughout the archipelago three main ritual officials appear to be the most important of those called the community nobles. These include ‘the master of the village’ (ahu dua), the ‘sacrificer’ (mela snoba, [74] and the ‘herald’ (mela fwaak). The master of the village is the senior representative of the named house that first occupied the land upon which the village stands and that first called the other dispersed groups together from their separate forest settlements when the village was founded. When a new house is built, he should be the first one to dig the earth for the foundation posts; and should the village move to a new site, his house should be the first to be built. The sacrifice is the official who is responsible for making sacrifices, offerings, and prayers to Ubila’a at the central altar in the stone boat. The herald is responsible for making known to the general populace the decisions that have been made by the community officials: these he cries out, with distinctive cadence, when he makes his rounds through the village … Whereas the mater of the village could be said to represent the entire village when it comes to temporal precedence on the land, it is the sacrifice and the herald who, together, provide an image of a gendered totality. Drabbe notes that the sacrificer is considered the ‘mother’ (renan) of the village, and the herald is thought of as the ‘father’ (yaman). Although, as such, they are central to all ritual activities of the village, their authority is nevertheless anything but absolute. ‘As in questions of war, so it went in other community affairs: “father” and “mother” were theoretically the boss, but they did not decide on anything without the consent of the community, and often the community went against their decision’ (1940:182). Indeed there are other officials who have special roles in any discussion of community matters. On Yamdena, there is an official called the ‘bow of the boat’ (sori luri). He is the one who, among his many other tasks, must speak first to open any community meeting. In some villages there is another official – called the ‘speaker’ (mangatanuk on Yamdena; mela ngrihi on Fordata, Larat, and Sera) – who took up the discussion and spoken after the ‘bow of the boat’ had opened the session. On Fordata, Larat, and Sera there is a special official, called ‘he answers the voice of the [community] nobles’ (nvalat mel vain). This man speaks for the general populace, which does not otherwise have a voice in the ritual gatherings, and he has the power to veto the decisions and plans of the main ritual officials. Another official central to various ritual proceedings is the ‘master of the divisions’ (wahat dua), who is responsible for the division of meat and rice on the occasion of a communal sacrificial meal.” (McKinnon, 1991, pp. 73-74)",mckinnon1991[73-79]
17761,ifugao,86,0,150-0,"Sources consistently describe the Ifugao as lacking formal political authority:

“It can be said that these simple folk do not recognize any kind of govern- ment. Those who are called chiefs among them are either the bravest or the richest, and their authority is limited to a certain deference they receive from those of their own village or sometimes of nearby vil- lages -without anybody believing that for this reason they have any obligation at all to carry out their orders. I have had many occasions to test what I have just said: when there would be reason for them to receive orders from the chiefs, they could be seen screaming at them and threatening them with earth and sky, but for all this the only success [100] they would have was that nobody would pay the least attention to what they were told. As I have already indicated, they are governed by custom, and with regard to justice, each takes it into his own hands.” (Alarcon & Scott, 1965, pp. 99-100)

""I have already said that the Ifugaos have no king, nor ruler. They pay tribute to no one. Each one is the absolute monarch of his house and person, and although this individual liberty is one of the principal causes of their miserable and almost anarchical state, it is certain that it is one of their most dominant passions."" (Villaverde, 1909, p. 241)

""Nobles who ruled over the separate islands or large districts bore the title of 'akariki … In the time of Apeiti … the two large districts of Rikitea and Taku were each ruled by a 'akariki. Through the conquest of Taku, Apeiti became ruler over the whole island of Mangareva, but his influence extended over the other islands as well. Except for the break caused by the commoner, Teiti-a-tuou, the descendants of Ruaga ruled as 'akariki until the arrival of the missionaries in 1834.

“The heir to the ‘akariki title had to be born on the marae of Te Kehika, and the mother was accordingly conveyed there when labor pains began ... On the eighth day the child underwent the igogo ceremony on the marae, and the high priest fed him to bring him under the direct protection of the gods ... [151] … The king was enveloped in a personal tapu due to his birth. The tapu of priests, on the other hand, was derived from their initiation as a medium of the gods. According to Laval ... the king who had the secular tapu alone was termed a kuare but some few were also charged with the sacred tapu and thus had a dual power expressed by the term taura-ariki (priest and king). The sacred tapu, however, was usually conferred on some other member of the royal family who was selected to function as high priest (taura-tupua).” "" (Buck, 1938, pp 151-152)","buck1938[151-155, 426-453]"

“Kei Adat and the origins of Larvul Ngabal’ (Hooe, 2012, pp. 112-120)

“Throughout the Kei archipelago, there are 19 … domains or ‘little kingdoms’, seven on the island of Kei Besar and twelve spread throughout the islands of Kei Kecil … Today, these domains are often referred to as ratschap, a term combining the Kei word rat [56] (king or chief) with the Dutch suffix ‘–schaap’ meaning “-ship” (Thorburn 2008:126). Ratschap was first used by the Dutch to refer the domains of the Kei Islands, which are sometimes referred to as lor in the Kei language (see Rahail 1993, 1996) … [57] … Each ratschap is headed by a rat. The ratschap of the Kei Islands are further organized into two large confederations or ‘political moieties’ (Valeri 1989) known as ur siu (the nine [58] moiety) and lor lim (the five moiety) (van Wouden 1966). 18 The Keiese claim that these nonterritorial confederations were mobilized in times of war and distress. Nine ratschap belong to the ur siu moiety, nine others belong to the lor lim moiety, while 2 ratschap are politically neutral (or lor labay). With the exception of these neutral ratschap, each domain consists of a number of villages, ranging from 3 villages (Songli centered in Rumat on Kei Kecil) to 46 villages (Maur Ohoivuut on Kei Besar).” (Hooe, 2012, pp. 55-58)

Functions of the rat prior to colonisation are not entirely clear – Hooe argues that the colonial process greatly increased their power. However, they traditionally claimed the right to administer adat law:

“Generally speaking, the closer a rat, and thus their contemporary descendants, to the source of adat law, the more authority and power they are able to claim in matters of adat. But regardless of a particular rat’s place in such a scheme, all Kei rat, from both the ‘nine’ and the ‘five’ moieties, became the owners and guardians of Kei adat law. The tom describing the origins and spread of Kei adat law, I would argue, clearly claim Larvul Ngabal as a proprietary domain of mel-mel leaders. In the Kei islands, at least from a mel-mel point of view, knowledge of and expertise in adat are claimed to be noble prerogatives.” (Hooe, 2012, p 120)","hooe-2012[53-63, 112-120]"

Political authority:

Difficult to code this, as the Laboya were under foreign rule during the time focus and had been for some time. Prior to Dutch control, the Laboya appear to have had no political authority beyond the 'clan'. A 'raja' for all of Laboya was appointed by the Dutch, but this position (and Laboya as an administrative entity) apparently disappeared under Indonesian rule:

“Into the political organization of each suku, the Dutch introduced a system of social stratification that was unknown to the Sumbanese. Each suku became a regency, or sometimes a sub-regency, headed by a raja appointed by the Dutch authorities. Such a political organization contrasted sharply with the indigenous system. By tradition, authority was partly a matter of alleged and mythical senior-ship often contested, particularly between ‘clans’, and partly a result of successful leadership in war. Under Dutch rule, the suku’s internal political organization was officially modified but the island’s division in suku was basically respected. Possibly the formal organization into kerajaan or ‘regencies’ implying more rigidly defined boundaries, may have even strengthened allegiance to the suku. Laboya became an autonomous regency, with its own raja … [4] … Independence of the Republic of Indonesia brought its own administrative changes. In modern Indonesia, a kecamatan is an administrative unit. In some cases in Sumba, a kecamatan corresponds exactly to a former regency, as in the case for Kodi. In other cases, however, a kecamatan may regroup several formerly autonomous areas. Thus the kecamatan of Walakaka embraces Laboya, Gaura, Wanokaka and Rua … But this administrative integration is too recent to have had a significant influence on feelings of identity with one’s suku.” (Geirnaert-Martin, 1992, pp. 3-4)

No political unity existed at the 'clan' level either. Laboya society consisted of kabihu ('clans') divided into Uma ('lineages' or 'houses'), which in turn consisted of multiple uma ('households'). Households were headed by senior men (Mori uma). Some Uma also had leaders or 'representatives' who did not have a name as such, but were referred to as 'elder brother' or 'father'. Kabihu do not appear to have had formal leadership, though they often had men called ata tada who acted as 'mediators'. Autonomous kabihu and Uma were called Inaya-Ama, 'Mother-Father'. 

""Laboya society consists of kabihu and uma. Onvlee, speaking about Sumabese communities in general, defines a kabihu or kabisu as a 'patrilineal and exogamous descent group', that is, a clan (1973:23; 102-112; 309) … However, some authors have questioned ‘the appropriateness of conventional anthropological concepts such as clan and lineage for the description of the social morphology’ of certain types of eastern Indonesian societies (Barraud and Platenkamp 1990: II-110).  Although I do not wish to discuss the problem of lineality in Eastern Indonesia, the question rises whether the unlinear principle implied by the terminology of 'clan' and 'lineage' truly corresponds to the situation in Laboya. It is for this reason that, in this book, I have opted for the indigenous terms kabihu and uma ... For the sake of clarity, I shall write Uma (House) when designating a group of people related by kin ties and uma when referring more specifically to the house as a building. This distinction is not always stated by the Laboya, the two meanings overlapping one another in many cases. But the Laboya do distinguish between the eldest male living in a particular house, the ‘Master/the Lord of a house’ called Mori uma, and the eldest male representative of an Uma. The latter is referred to as ‘elder brother’ (anguwu pa kaya) or ‘father’ (ama) by younger descendants who mostly inhabit other houses situated either in the same village or a different settlement. 

“[17] The territory of an Uma, hence of a kabihu, consists of a place in a village (harona) where the founding ancestors built the first house and of scattered plots of land belonging to its members … Among the Laboya, a kabihu encompasses a number of smaller units called Uma (Houses). The relationships between the Uma are conceived of in terms of patrilineal descent. The ranking order of the ‘Houses’ is determined by the mythical order of birth of their founding fathers. A kabihu consists of an ‘Elder House’ (Uma pa kaya) and of several ‘younger Houses’ (Uma pa ali.” (Geirnaert-Martin, 1992, pp. 17-18)

“In this complex situation, a crucial matter deserves special attention. When people want to stress the point that their kabihu or Uma is the unit that differentiates itself from other kabihu or Uma, they say that their kabihu or Uma is Inaya-Ama, ‘Mother-Father’ … In Laboya, Inya-Ama is explained as follows: ‘The fact that we are Inya-Ama demonstrates that nobody can give us orders.’

“Implicit in this statement lies the social rule according to which a younger brother has to obey and help his elder sibling. In rituals, representatives of a younger Uma must comply with the orders given by their counterparts in the eldest Uma. When they say ‘we are Inya-Ama’, the men of a particular Uma express the fact that as a genealogical unit, they have become independent because not even an elder branch can impose its rules upon them.” (Geirnaert-Martin, 1992, p. 19)

“The Laboya also make a social distinction between the ata pote and the ata tada. The ata pote (‘rich men’) do not accumulate goods for the pleasure of being rich … Rich men must have accordingly, that is, they must give many feasts to show their wealth and redistribute it, thereby re-activating long-standing relationships and creating new ones … In contrast, ata tada are not necessarily noble although they are never descendants of ‘slaves’. Nor are they necessarily very rich; yet a poor man can never become one of them. They are wise, mature men who have oratory skills and who know how to settle disputes. Nearly every kabihu has its own ata tada who may be requested to act as a go-between … during marriage settlements, or at the occasion of any ceremony during which gifts between wife-givers and wife-takers have to be exchanged.” (Geirnaert-Martin, 1992, p. 197)

Villages were made up of multiple kabihu, and kabihu were spread across multiple villages:

“In Laboya, several kabihu live in the same village (harona) and a settlement is not an exogamous unit as it is the case [sic] in Kodi.” (Geirnaert-Martin, 1992, p. 17, Footnote 2). 

“Geographically and ritually, Hodana is the centre of Laboya, from where all kabihu of Laboya proper and of Patyala have originated. Ideally, all of them are supposed to have their ancestral house in Hodana. In practice, several kabihu, for example Welowa, Ubumaleha and Kadengara, have established their own ancestral villages elsewhere long ago … [145] … The site where an ancestral house should stand is supposed to correspond to the one appointed by Ubu Raba, Ubu Rehi, Anamalangta Bawe and other apical ancestors. At the time when they organized Pa?u and Nyale, the ancestors assigned specific tasks in the yearly rituals to each kabihu and Uma and this arrangement is presented as immutable. In accordance with their ceremonial role during Paδu and Nyale, the kabihu were given a special place on which to build their first house. Therefore, the geographical mapping of Hodana corresponds to a ritually significant social division.” (Geirnaert, 1992, pp. 144-145)

The 'Mori uma' led the household in feasting and previously in warfare. The relationship between different Mori uma within the same Uma or Kabihu appears to have been fairly egalitarian:

“A ‘Mori uma’ or ‘Master of a house’, usually the eldest living male in a house, becomes a ‘Master of the feast’ … whenever he organizes a feast. He does not keep the honour and the renown he obtains on such an occasion all to himself. He must share it with his brothers who have been messengers between himself and his guests and have helped him with the organization … These rules are the same as the ones that applied in the past to the organization of headhunting raids. Ideally a war leader and his brothers first decided which men to ask to participate. Then brothers were sent off to visit those men and invite them. If the party succeeded in taking heads the war leader and his brothers shared the prestige obtained for organizing a successful raid. However, if one of the invited participants was injured or killed, the war leader and his brothers had the duty to pay a blood-price (taupe) to the family. Brothers, hence the members of an Uma and ultimately all brothers of a kabihu, are said to ‘share the same name’. A ‘man of renown’ (ata pagnara) shares his prestige with his brothers, that is the members of his Uma. If a kabihu consists of many Uma whose members are rich enough to give many feasts, the kabihu is considered as a ‘big kabihu with many children’: a particularly wealthy kabihu whose male members are able to marry several wives who then give birth to many children … [31] … The renown obtained by the living members of a kabihu or of an Uma when organizing successful feasts contributes to the permanence of that kabihu or Uma as a social unit, a totality, consisting of ancestors and of their descendants.” (Geirnaert-Martin, 1992, pp. 30-31)

Religious authority:

Religious authority in Laboya appears to have been vested in groups (kabihu and Uma) rather than individuals, but it was exercised by religious practioners called rato. Various kabihu and Uma played specific roles in the Pan-Laboyan paδu and nyale ceremonies. No one group predominated, and there was a considerable 'turnover' of which group occupied which role. The Kabihu 'Modo', who played an important (though not supreme) role in the ceremonies, was recognised as the 'Lord of the Land' throughout Laboya and had certain religious prerogatives.

""Paδu and Nyale are the names of the two main yearly rituals which punctuate the Laboya agricultural cycle, their social and ceremonial life ... Paδu is held at the end of the dry season, in October for Laboya proper and in November for Patyala ... Both Laboya proper and Patyala celebrate Nyale together in February, at the height of the rainy season, ideally just before the planting of the rice seasons ... Paδu is the most important yearly ceremony for for mountain people, such as Lolinese, whereas Nyale festivities are the prerogative of coastal communities such as Kodi and Wanokaka ... Paδu is not entirely absent from the ritual cycle of the Kodinese or of the inhabitants of Wanukaka but to them this ritual plays a subsidary role ... [12] ... Apparently, location determines which of the two ceremonies is the most important. The Laboya, however, consider themselves an exception, a state confirmed by the sayings of all other West Sumbanese. The Laboya, following the instructions of the ancestors, hold both ceremonies because as they say, you cannot have Paδu without Nyale and vice versa ... The Laboya take considerable pride in the fact that they alone are entitled to celebrate both Paδu and Nyale. The underlying idea is that being blessed by the ancestors, they contribute most to the spiritual and material needs of all West Sumbanese."" (Geirnaert, 1992, pp. 11-12)

""Under the name of Ubu Jara (Lord Horse), Ubu Raba became the ancestor of kabihu Modo and Ubu Jara's original loom, heddle stick, shed rod and sword are kept among the sacred heirlooms in the ancestral house of kabihu Modo right up to this day. Like Ubu Jara, kabihu Modo is the Mori Tana, Ind. Tuan Tanah, the 'Lord of the Land,' the 'Owner of the Earth' of Laboya. Whenever one digs a hole on a new plot of land, one has to inform kabihu Modo and give their [37] religious practitioner (rato) a chicken, betel and areca nut so that he may proceeed and make offerings to the spirit of Ubu Jara."" (Geirnaert-Martin, 1992, pp. 36-37)

""Hodana is the village where the first ancestors of Laboya settled after their long migration from camp Sasar. Ubu Raba, who often took the shape of a python and who became later an ancestor of kabihu Modo ... invited all people to come to Hodana. To insure the arrival of the rains and to organize farming, Ubab Raba and other elders ... decided to organize and perform Pa?u and Nyale for which each kabihu was assigned a ritual task. The assignment of ritual tasks to each kabihu during Pa?u and Nyale constitutes the foundation of Laboya society."" (Geirnaert-Martin, 1992, p 138). 

“Geographically and ritually, Hodana is the centre of Laboya, from where all kabihu of Laboya proper and of Patyala have originated. Ideally, all of them are supposed to have their ancestral house in Hodana. In practice, several kabihu, for example Welowa, Ubumaleha and Kadengara, have established their own ancestral villages elsewhere long ago … [145] … The site where an ancestral house should stand is supposed to correspond to the one appointed by Ubu Raba, Ubu Rehi, Anamalangta Bawe and other apical ancestors.

In accordance with their ceremonial role during Paδu and Nyale, the kabihu were given a special place on which to build their first house. Therefore, the geographical mapping of Hodana corresponds to a ritually significant social division.” (Geirnaert, 1992, pp. 144-145)

""Next to these five categories of people, exists another group of people called the rato who are part-time religious practitioners. Unlike the former, the latter is determined by patrilineal descent. Ideally a rato is a direct descendant of an uma's [house's] founding ancestor ...In the ancestral villages of Hodana, Motodawu and Malihu, a rato is in charge of the ritual tasks assigned by the first ancestors to his Uma for the celebration of pa?u and Nyale ...Rato are supposed to lead exemplary lives ... I was told that, in the past, they were also not allowed to take part in head-hunting raids. Perhaps the rato formed a relatively neutral category with mediatory skills ...  It seems that rato were in charge of religious affairs whereas the ata pote [rich men] took care of the increase of the wealth and renown of their Uma, a division found in other parts of Indonesia as well.""

Economically, the King is not necessarily better off than the wealthy people of the island. … Next to the king, the high priest had much influence upon the administration of public affairs, which is obvious from his title ariki takatonga, or, ariki sili (sili = the more important one).

It may be that the marae’s ‘owner,’ the king [i.e. tribal chief], was more important overall, but his role in religious ceremonies was purely passive, while the high priest, who mediated between king and deity, played a very active part in all religious events … But his activities were not confined within marae precincts; in other [secular] affairs as well he exercised immense influence, depending more or less on the character of the king (as is usually the case in such circumstances) … In fact, the high priest’s jurisdiction resembled that of a bishop. It [usually] extended over all the maraes located in the territory ruled by his sovereign chief; but there were exceptions to such parallel jurisdictions. In some cases, for example, a chief had two or more high priests in his domain; in other cases a high priest’s jurisdiction extended over two [independent] tribal domains. And finally, there were certain ‘international’ maraes served by the most renowned high priest thereabouts [regardless of tribal domain].” (de Bovis, 1909, as quoted in Oliver, 1974, p 869)",oliver1974[869]

‘Narrating the path of Ma’saman.uey’ (Boulan-Smit, 1998, pp. 91-132)

‘Hena Manusa: Seven positions, seven nuru’ (Boulan-Smit, 1998, pp. 138-149)

The Alune lived in semi-autonomous territories called hena (domains). One of these hena, Manusa, is described in detail in the source (Boulan-Smit, 1998).

In the twentieth century hena populations were consolidated into nucleated villages, but previously they appear to have consisted of several settlements. Manusa, which had an area of 181 sq. km (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 12), consisted of several ‘hamlets’ (p 169), which were not tightly clustered (Fig. 6.1). 

Governance of the hena was vested in the hena upui (‘grandfathers of the domain’). Boulan-Smit (1998, pp. 138-149) describes seven offices:

""Seven is also the number of functions and duties which order the ancient social [138] organisation of the hena to make it a complete body. These are the positions/duties (tugas) of hena upui grandfathers / ancestors of the hena'. At the present time, the seven hena upui are recalled as follows: Latu ela mena: ('Great lord in the front'), the leader/ruler/head, upu tapele: the lord of the land, maeta'e: the ritual performer, ama lesi: the warlord, ama nili: the saniri elder, peace negotiator, alamanane: the spokesman, and ama tita: the liaison agent … Let us  examine these functions more closely."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, pp. 137-138)

The offices of Latu ela mena, upu tapele, and maeta’e appear to have been the most important, since they were associated with the ‘three latu [lords]’ of the domain:

""Everybody in Manusa agrees that the three functions of leader, lord of the land and ritual performer were filled by the three latu."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 138)

The Latu ela mena ('leader') appears to have been the nominal leader of the domain. His role is somewhat obscure – in Manusa, where Boulan-Smit conducted her fieldwork, the office had long been unfilled. 

""Everybody in Manusa agrees that the three functions of leader, lord of the land and ritual performer were filled by the three latu. However, in the narrative the first leader, Latuelamena, left at the foundation of the domain. Some elders support the case that he was immediately replaced by the warlord, others that his powerless representative (Tibali, nicknamed ana sosi 'the ignorant child') filled his empty seat while his function was assumed by others. This is where tradition and official history are interwoven. No one remembers [139] who (other than Latuelamena) led Manusa before 1920, when colonial interference started to be felt and was documented."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, pp. 138-139)

The upu tapele ('lord of the land') was an authority on 'customary law and land tenure' within the hena, as well as having 'privileged contact with the ancestors of the hena':

""In Manusa, the 'lord of the land' (upu tapele) is indeed knowledgeable and regarded as the one to whom to refer on matters of customary law and land tenure as long as they concern the 'land' (tapele) and the 'custom' (atate) within the hena itself. The upu tapele is the descendant of the founding ancestor of the domain. Because of this ancestry he has a privileged contact with the ancestors of the hena … However an upu is the lord, the custodian, the guardian, the person having duties and responsibilities toward something, but not its owner."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 140)

The maeta'e ('ritual performer') 'collected offerings' for domain-wide rituals and was also an officiant of the Kakehan (a ritual 'brotherhood'):

""The ritual performer collected the offerings of all the nuru for their common ritual centre on Nuruitu. He was also the ritual officiant of the Kakehan ('a'ehane) in the 'men's house' (luma tutue) before the prohibition of initiation and men's rituals in the 1920s, when the village officially converted to Christianity."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 142)

The ama lesi appears to have been some kind of shaman as well as a warlord:

""Van Wouden attributed to the malesi the role of a 'champion' but also the duties of a diviner or an astrologer, an activity he did not investigate further. Shamanism was a common practice among Alune elders before the conversion to Christianity. The shamanic aspect of the amalesi's charge applied in matters which concerned his field of specialisation i.e. warfare, head hunting, the movements of the group (he led migrations), protection or extension of the boundaries, and men's activities related to the forest."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 142)

The ama nili headed the domain council and represented the domain on larger councils. This role may have been a new (postcolonial?) introduction:

""The function I call peace negotiator is ama nili: 'saniri father'. In peace time, his role was to head the 'village council of elders' (nili) and to act as the representative of the hena in the larger saniri (nili ela) of the river batai. As head of the elders' council he was expected to be [144] knowledgeable in customary matters, more specifically in what concerned the administrative relationship with the outside, including land boundaries … For some village elders, the function is regarded as a 'new' one."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, pp. 143-144)

The roles of alamanane and the ama tita (‘left hand’ and ‘right hand’) were clearly subsidiary. The former assisted the maeta’e (Boulan-Smit, 1998, pp. 145-146), and the latter assisted the village council (p. 146). 

The hena appears to have been the only religious grouping situated wholly within Alune society. Above the hena level, a 'ritual brotherhood' called the Kakehan existed throughout Western Seram. The mountain peoples (Alune and Wemale) were involved in the Kakehan and  were called 'Black Siwa' in contrast to the coastal Muslims who for the most part were not involved in the Kakehan and were known as 'White Siwa'. All the people of Western Seram considered themselves 'Siwa', and shared an origin myth involving the Nunusaku tree, which was linked in some unknown way to the Kakehan. While coastal Muslims had nominal precedence in the 'nili' system of regional assemblies, the Alune and Wemale had a kind of religious precedence on the basis that they were 'guardians of the Nunusaku'. The Alune hena of Manusa made a specific claim to be the guardians of the Nunusaku, but it is not clear how widely this claim was accepted.

“The mountain people of west Seram were Black Siwa (Kakehan initiates), and the coastal settlers White Siwa, but all were Pata Siwa, (Group of Nine), while the east of the island was inhabited by the Pata Lima (Group of Five). Although this is not the case anymore, we may suppose that it gave the Siwa a minimal sense of common identity ... Furthermore, the idea of a common origin linked to a central mountain and to a sacred banyan tree called Nunusaku, was largely shared throughout west Seram, even among the coastal newcomers.” (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 73)

“Spreading its branches to the Sky (Lanite) and its roots into the Earth (Tapele), Nunusaku is also the source of the three rivers, Eti, Tala and Sapalewa, which give the area its name: the Three Rivers, 'Wele Batai Telu. The people established in this area and those living on the southern islands of Ambon and Uliase, all link their origin to the Nunusaku, even the population of mixed origin. Most regard the Alune and Wemale mountain people of west Seram as the direct descendants and thus the custodians of the Nunusaku."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 101)

“Besides being the historical validation of their territorial claims and the justification of their political position toward external and internal affairs, this topogeny supports the establishment of their macrocosmic order. It confirms Manusa as one source/centre through the deeds of its founding ancestor. It also positions the hena as custodian (not owner) of Nunusaku, the ultimate sacred centre of the region, which joins Tapele, the Earth, to Lanite, the Sky, the microcosm to the macrocosm.” (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 103)

""Along the coasts down from each valley, large settlements of mixed population were controlled by Muslim rulers allied to Ternate. Eti in the Eti valley, Kairatu in the Tala, and Lissabata in the Sapalewa were such coastal centres in the nineteenth century. Through wealth, influence and politics, their leaders nominally controlled each valley (batai), heading large assemblies (nili) of the representatives of each riverine domain ... [276] ... The centre of power of the batai had its base (uwei) at the coast and its ramifications in the mountains. Larger ceremonial assemblies were also held at federative level. They convened the warlords, leaders and ritual performers of all the domains which were members of the Kakehan. The male brotherhood demanded of its initiates a vow of secrecy in regard to their belief, their initiation rituals and head hunting practices. Infringement led to dishonourable death. This knowledge, which elders say 'pertains to Nunusaku', had its symbolic centre in the mountains among the black Siwa; the white Siwa being the populations at its coastal periphery."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 276)

More on the Kakehan:

“The division between black and white siwa is given several explanations. The colour black is usually related to the tattoo of the members of the Kakehan initiation brotherhood. Most of the black tattooed siwa lived in the mountains. They were distinguished from the white or not tattooed siwa, the non-initiated people living in the coastal regions of 'Wele Telu. Hence, this distinction between initiates and non-initiates demarcated the mountain from the coastal populations (although some individuals of the coast were initiated).” (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 115)

""As Sachse comments, the prohibition of the Kakehan in 1914 had left a spiritual vacuum."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 65)

""The authors usually translate mauwen or (mawene) anakota (captain of a boat) as 'high priest' because the mauwena were also leading dignitaries in the Kakehan. Indeed, the role of the Kakehan was also to ensure that traditional law was implemented among its members."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 78)

""Although a lot has been written about the Kakehan little is known about this men's cult, the role of its ritual performers, its initiation rituals and head hunting practices."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 142)

""In archives, mauwen is usually translated by 'Kakehan priest' ... The mauwen anakota was the leader of the local unit of the Kakehan cult."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 147)

""Somehow the church replaced the Kakehan house. An elder said that formerly Manusa had been the centre of initiation for
several mountain communities and it was thus normal that it now had the largest church."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 355)","boulan-smit-1998[71-132, 138-149, 275-276]"

But the chiefs of the main line did not renounce or lose their right to sacrifice to their ancestors. In Lau, in later years, a chief only exercised his right to sacrifice if the priest was unwilling to do so. A priest, however, would refuse at the risk of his life, for the ancestral ghosts in their anger would cause his death."" (Ivens, 1930, p 150)","ivens1930[84, 150]"

'Religion' (Jenks, 1905) pp. 196-215

The Bontok people lived in villages ('pueblos') divided into wards (ato). Politics and religion appear to have been well-differentiated. Political authority was in the hands of intugtukan ('elders'), whereas religious authority was in the hands of various specialists. However, the scope of political authority was not equal: intugtukan only had authority over their ato, whereas there was a village-wide priesthood. At least one of the three categories of priest appears to have exercised some authority over the intugtukan, who appear to have been bound by their decisions:

""There are three classes of persons who stand between the people and Lumawig, and to-day all hold an hereditary office. The first class is called ‘Wa-kü′,’ of which there are three men, namely, Fug-ku-so′, of ato Somowan, Fang-u-wa′, of ato Lowingan, and Cho-Iûg′, of ato Sigichan. The function of these men is to decide and announce the time of all rest days and ceremonials for the pueblo. These Wa-kü′ inform the old men of each ato, and they in turn announce the days to the ato … The title of the second class of intercessors is ‘Pa′-tay,’ of whom there are two in Bontoc—Kad-lo′-san, of ato Somowan, and Fi′-Iûg, of ato Longfoy. 

[206] ""The Pa′-tay illustrate the nature of the titles borne by all the intercessors. The title is the same as the name of the ceremony or one of the ceremonies which the person performs.
Once every new moon each Pa′-tay performs the pa′-tay ceremony in the sacred grove near the pueblo. This ceremony is for the general well-being of the pueblo.

""The third class of intercessors has duties of a two-fold nature. One is to allay the rain and wind storms, called ‘baguios,’ and to drive away the cold; and the other is to petition for conditions favorable to crops. There are seven of these men, and each has a distinct title. All are apparently of equal importance to the group."" (Jenks, 1905, pp. 205-206)","jenks1905[167-171, 196-215]"

The pattern of a diarchical division of power and authority between a secular ruler and a ritual authority, common to other eastern Indonesian societies, is reflected in a division by which women, as the heads of clans, exercise secular authority over domestic and horticultural matters and men, as the ritual specialists of the domain, exercise sacred authority, principally in the execution of ritual … When dealing with secular matters, men are conceived as acting as the delegates of their sisters and clan or lepo mothers … In Tana 'Ai, women rule within autonomous social units and men, in whom is vested authority for the conduct of the external affairs of the group, are the ‘glue’ that binds the confederation of diverse clans and houses into the larger domain.” (Lewis, 1993, p. 25)",lewis1993[25]

""1.	Government, to the chiefs

""2.	Butchering of turtles, to the highest chief of Kovalu clan

""3.	Navigation, to accredited palu...

""6.	Some healing procedures, to tautave,

""7.	Intercession with the gods, to taubwongbwong..."" (Burrows & Spiro 1953 p. 160)

""Several points in this elaboration of rank—particularly the awe of ancestral chiefs shown in the respect for the old site at Katēlū, and the formalities about turtle—suggest the Polynesian complex of chieftainship. There, chiefs commonly traced their ancestry to gods—indeed, the most influential gods, or some of them, seem to have been deified chiefly ancestors. And living chiefs were thought to embody some of this divinity. As for turtle, in more than one part of Polynesia it was offered to the paramount chief explicitly in his divine capacity.

""It seems highly probable that the chieftainship complex of Polynesia and that exemplified by Ifaluk are historically related. But it is clear that in Ifaluk, though native religion still flourishes, the respect shown to chiefs does not include attribution of divinity to them. The oracles of the gods are typically not chiefs. Chiefs do not trace their descent from the gods—infact, divine genealogies are patrilineal, human ones matrilineal, and both very brief. Exceept in association with Katēlū, ghosts of chiefs seem no more important than any other ghosts. In sum, religion on Ifaluk does not support government in this particular way.""

19051,motu,84,1,149-1,"The Motu lived in villages divided into ‘wards’ (iduhu). Formal leadership was limited to the latter. 

There are two significant corporate groups in a Motu village: the household, comprising one or more nuclear families; and the iduhu, comprising a number of households located together in their own residential section of the village … Although there are perceived to be specific historical links between certain Motu villages, traditionally all villages were politically independent and there was no formal socio-political organization above the village level. Normally, the senior married male agnate is recognized within an iduhu as its leader, and within a household as its head, and the status of other male members is determined by genealogical seniority both within and between generations. At the village level, there was traditionally no formal status hierarchy, but prominent men, for the most part iduhu leaders, competed for status and influence through the sponsorship and management of enterprises that conferred prestige, such as hiri expeditions, feasts with dancing, bride-wealth payments, and (in precolonial times) feats of military leadership. (Groves, 1991, p 214)

‘Specialist religious practitioners’ are denied;

""There were no specialist religious practitioners in traditional Motu society, except for diviners who could identify certain illnesses and calamities as punishments for particular infringements of the ancestral code or as the effects of sorcery (mea) or witchcraft (vada). The Motu believed that, in general, only Koita and other neighboring peoples practiced sorcery and witchcraft, but individual Motu could buy or otherwise enlist their services or skills."" (Groves, 1991, p 215)

Iduhu appears to have been the largest ritual unit. The iduhu head (kwarana) is strongly implied to have directed iduhu rituals:

""Motu traditionally believed that their well-being depended on the continued support of their ancestral spirits, who were believed to go after death to a place of plenty over the sea, to the west, but who were thought also to maintain a concern for, and spiritual contact with, their living descendants in the village. Households and iduhu regularly performed mystical rites instituted by their ancestors to promote success in such enterprises as gardening, fishing, and the hiri."" (Groves, 1991, p 215)

""Poreporena had no government, but it did have leaders. In each iduhu, leadership was usually hereditary, descending from eldest son to eldest son in the senior male line. The incumbent  was called the iduhu kwarana, 'head' of the iduhu, and in Motu the word kwara was used, as in English, to denote both the head as a part of the body and the senior man in a group; its emphasis was on formal status, in this case genealogical status … [81] … The iduhu kwarana lived in the front house of the iduhu, and his verandah (dehe) was the  ceremonial focus of the iduhu. On it, at all times, the older men of the iduhu (the tau badana) met and gossiped. On it, during a feast, foodstuffs were placed to honour the lineage forbears. On it decisions were taken and agreements reached. The dehe was, in a sense, the iduhu's temple and its consultative chamber, but such analogies gravely distort the facts; the iduhu kwarana was neither a political authority nor a priest, he was simply the senior elder (primus  inter pares) whose ritual associations and worldly opinions were entitled to special respect. There was no political machinery, and there were no formal sanctions to enforce decisions."" (Groves, 1954, pp 80-81)","groves1991[214, 215];groves-2011[80-81]"

19056,motu,86,1,150-1,"""At the time of their first recorded contact with Westerners, in 1872, the Austronesian-speaking people known as Motu lived in thirteen nucleated seaside villages on the south coast of the New Guinea mainland, immediately east and west of Port Moresby ... [213] ... Although no precise figures are available,
from the random observations of early missionaries and other
visitors the total population of all Motu villages at the time of
first contact, including the small Koita minorities in some villages, has been estimated at between 4,000 and 5,000 ... Motu villages were traditionally closely nucleated, the houses
typically built out in lines over the water. Wooden walkways
linked the houses in each line. Each of the independent, localized descent groups (iduhu), which together constituted the
village polity, occupied its own line of houses ... [214] ... Normally, the senior married male agnate is recognized within an iduhu as its leader, and within a household as its head, and the status of other male members is determined by genealogical seniority both between and within generations. At the village level, there was traditionally no formal status hierarchy, but prominent men, for the most part iduhu leaders, competed for status and influence through the sponsorship and management of enterprises that conferred prestige, such as hiri expeditions, feasts with dancing, bride-wealth payments, and (in precolonial times) feats of military leadership ... Political decisions at the village level were traditionally achieved and maintained through
public debate, in which political leaders (big-men) used a rhetoric invoking their superior achievements and prestige,
which in turn reflected the range and size of their support networks, to 'shame"" other participants out of contention until a
clear victor or a winning consensus emerged.'' (Groves, 1991, pp. 212-214)

""Poreporena had no government, but it did have leaders. In each iduhu, leadership was usually hereditary, descending from eldest son to eldest son in the senior male line. The incumbent  was called the iduhu kwarana, 'head' of the iduhu, and in Motu the word kwara was used, as in English, to denote both the head as a part of the body and the senior man in a group; its emphasis was on formal status, in this case genealogical status … [81] … The iduhu kwarana lived in the front house of the iduhu, and his verandah (dehe) was the  ceremonial focus of the iduhu. On it, at all times, the older men of the iduhu (the tau badana) met and gossiped. On it, during a feast, foodstuffs were placed to honour the lineage forbears. On it decisions were taken and agreements reached. The dehe was, in a sense, the iduhu's temple and its consultative chamber, but such analogies gravely distort the facts; the iduhu kwarana was neither a political authority nor a priest, he was simply the senior elder (primus  inter pares) whose ritual associations and worldly opinions were entitled to special respect. There was no political machinery, and there were no formal sanctions."" (Groves, 2011, pp 80-81)",groves1991[212-214]

""The development of the Uvean kingdom from a land of rival chiefs is shadowed forth in Henquel's history. The present local government, the outcome of that process, is still a native institution in most respects, though the district and some details of procedure, as collection of taxes imposed by the French, are European.

""The political units are kingdom, district, and village. Each is governed by an executive officer and a council (fono) ... Mangaret ... quotes from Bataillon the following statement of the king's powers:

""'The king enjoys all the power which we like to recognise in great princes; thus, he has right of life and death over his subjects; the control of their goods is in his hands; he can put tapus on the whole ppulation, impose certain labor taxes, make peace or war. It is his place to preside at public assemblies, kavas, and solemn festivities.'

""How far a particular king exercised these powers depended naturally on his individual character and the state of the country. Henquel tells of the assassination of several early kings. Recent deposition of a king by the ministers, often under foreign influence, has been common. Early missionary letters repeatedly speak of the king as a vacillating character ... [77] ... But Queen Amelia was a true sovereign ... The ministers (kau-aliki, kau-fau), in addition to serving on the council, have specialized functions. Kivalu is generally called prime minister by Europeans. Bataillon says that the king reigns, while Kivalu governs. But the king of whom he wrote was the pusillanimous Lavelua of the Oldham report. Kivalu is supposed to supervise foreign relations, which means in practice only that he consults with the French resident about such matters as taxes.

""Mukoi-fenua is supposed to be minister of war. This seems an empty dignity since the French government has been in control, but he may have influence in inter-district quarrels.

""Fotutamai, last in rank of the ministers, is also village chief of Matautu, where the king lives ... Puliuvea, village chief of Akaaka, is called commander of the army, under Mukoi-fenua. He sometimes acts as a messenger for the king, and it is he who tells a king when he has been deposed. Other village chiefs officiate only in their villages and in the district council ... The royal council (fono faka-lavelua, fono hau) consists of the king and his ministers. It holds regular meetings once a month, and special meetings whenever necessary.""

21159,rarotonga,84,3,149-3,"‘Introduction’ (Baltaxe, 1975, pp. 1-18)

‘Population: Pressure and distribution’ (Baltaxe, 1975, pp. 33-61)

‘Traditional histories or Rarotonga’ (Baltaxe, 1975, pp. 62-96)

Settlement of Rarotonga was dispersed within land units called tapere:

“The Ara Metua, more properly called Te Ara Nui A Toi, the Great Road of Toi, is the major archaeological feature of the island and its size and complex con-[48] struction have attracted a great deal of attention from those European scholars concerned with pre-contact Rarotonga … Both of these passages describe the skeleton of the Ara Metua, its remains some sixty or ninety years after the construction of the modern coastal road at the insistence of the early missionaries. On the other hand, John Williams certainly saw the Ara Metua in very much its pre-European contact state, describing it as ‘… a good road around the island …’ which required and received extensive care … [49] … These passages raise a number of important issues, among them the problems of determining the nature and locations of the settlements along the Ara Metua … In spite of the statement quotes [sic] above, the archaeological surveys of Rarotonga to which we have been referring in the past several pages show that there is actually no evidence of the existence of nucleated villages in the coastal area …. [50] … Presumably, the houses along the Ara Metua were clustered to some degree around the marae which were linked by that road, this in turn reflecting some of the major social ties of the inhabitants of the territorial units containing those marae.

“Such clustering could easily give an outsider an impression of discrete, although dispersed, villages, clearly separated geographically and possessing individual names, hence corporate identities. The references in the early ethnographic literature, such as those cited above, to ‘villages’ on Rarotonga at or before the time of European contact merely express that impression and should not be taken as referring to residential units per se. The primary factors governing residential location most likely were claims to, and competition for, land, access to a variety of resources within a relatively small area and, ultimately, security of occupation in the face of the threat of attack from neighbouring districts. All of these would have been most directly related to membership in the groups inhabiting the territorial units known as tapere.” (Baltaxe, 1975, pp. 47-50)

Each tapere was occupied by a kin group called a ngati:

""A tapere is often named by reference to a specific group of people who are said to be living on that land by virtue of 'blood right'. This group is itself referred to by the term ngati followed by the name of the title at its head ..."" (Baltaxe, 1975, p. 60)

Each ngati was led by mataiapo or ariki, and was part of a larger unit called the vaka. Each vaka was nominally led by an ariki, whose position among the mataiapo, however, is described as 'primus inter pares':

“We can define a corporate title as one which has immediate reference to the leadership of a specific, kinship-based, landholding corporation … These groups were fundamentally bilateral but a strong residential restriction on membership combined with a general rule of virilocality to lend them an appearance of patrilineal organization … Such a group and no other could properly be called a ngati in traditional terms.

“We will see later that particular genealogical relationships provided the basis for membership in a ngati but that the position of a specific individual within his ngati depended to a very large degree on his own personal capabilities, subject to an essentially political evaluation of the quality of his participation as well as the weight of his genealogical connections. While succession to a corporate title was in principle hereditary, ideally passing from father to eldest son, the specific person to fill such a position had to be confirmed by some immediate political process: election by the other ranking members of the corporation, military prowess hence power, or some other demonstration of mana, the recognition of which was the ultimate sanction and basis for leadership … [11] … There were two types of corporate title on Rarotonga before the end of the last century, ariki and mataiapo. One of the main tasks of this paper will be to establish the exact relationship between these two titles, but it appears that, until recently, there was little difference between them in practical terms. The mataiapo title appears to me to be basic, while the ariki is putatively senior mataiapo who is at the head of a confederation of related and contiguous ngati which comprise a vaka, usually translated as ‘tribe’. Thus the ariki was traditionally primus inter pares among the military and political leadership of the vaka, and he maintained that position by a series of marriage and adoptive alliances which supported his claims to genealogical seniority.

“But not all of the traditional titles were corporate as I have defined the term. At the beginning of the period to be covered by this study, the rangatira appears to have been a functionally defined status with an eligibility criterion of close, consanguineal relationship to the leader of some corporation, either an ariki or a mataiapo, as the case may be. Each rangatira was directly subordinate to a specific title of either rank.” (Baltaxe, 1975, pp. 10-11)

“The largest divisions in the society at the time of European contact were called vaka, literally the canoes of two individuals, Tangiia and Karika, who arrived at the island in about the thirteenth century. The vaka were consciously [63] organized political alliances of smaller, autonomous units, occupying specific tapere and led by people holding mataiapo and ariki titles. Thus the composition of the vaka can best be understood in terms of the deliberate analogy with the crew of a canoe in spite of the idiom of common consanguineal connections between all of its members; such connections, when they did exist were the result of later marriages among members of the component ngati … The distinction between, the ranks of ariki and mataiapo which has been so strongly emphasized by most European writers and government officials appears to have been much less clearly drawn before European contact than it was during the 19th century. While the exact nature of that relationship is still problematical, the significant distinction which appears in these traditional histories seems to separate the independent, corporate titles from the dependent, personal titles of komono and rangatira. The untitled people, the unga, hardly figure in these traditional narratives at all.” (Baltaxe, 1975, pp. 62-63)

Each vaka had a 'high priest', ta'unga:

“Te Ariki Taraare’s knowledge was not surprising since he ‘was the last of the high priests (ta’unga) of Rarotonga. His family have borne that name for some twenty generations and they have always performed the function of anointing and consecrating the [Makea] Ariki … at the sacred marae of Arai-te-tonga’ (Smith in Te Ariki Taraare 1899:61).

“Another major source was More Taunga-o-te-tini, who provided many of the stories and notes translated by Stephen Savage. More was ‘a descendant of the high priest More-moate and also of another high priest named Maoate-atua, both of whom joined Tangiia-nui’s expedition when [he] was fleeing from his cousin [and adoptive as well as classificatory brother], Tutapu. The More of that period came onto Rarotonga with Tangiia, as one of his high priests and was afterwards placed under the jurisdiction of Pa-ariki (Te Ariki Upokotini) and Motoro (Te Ariki Tinomana) by Tangiia-Nui, and was given certain priestly offices to perform …’ (Savage 1910:143).

“The apparent contradiction concerning Te Ariki Taraare’s status as the ‘last of the high priests of Rarotonga’ is easily resolved. Smith has assumed that the ta’unga’s special relationship to Makea, and his officiating at the marae at Arai-te-tonga, conferred on him a position analogous to Makea’s ‘royal’ supremacy over the island. Since the latter’s position was largely a European creation, the assumption naturally was false, but it does seem to have set a precedent for describing the ta’unga charged with special duties vis-à-vis an ariki as a ‘high priest’.” (Baltaxe, 1975, p. 68)","baltaxe-1975[1-18, 33-96]"

19052,motu,85,1,151-1,"""Poreporena had no government, but it did have leaders. In each iduhu, leadership was usually hereditary, descending from eldest son to eldest son in the senior male line. The incumbent  was called the iduhu kwarana, 'head' of the iduhu, and in Motu the word kwara was used, as in English, to denote both the head as a part of the body and the senior man in a group; its emphasis was on formal status, in this case genealogical status … [81] … The iduhu kwarana lived in the front house of the iduhu, and his verandah (dehe) was the  ceremonial focus of the iduhu. On it, at all times, the older men of the iduhu (the tau badana) met and gossiped. On it, during a feast, foodstuffs were placed to honour the lineage forbears. On it decisions were taken and agreements reached. The dehe was, in a sense, the iduhu's temple and its consultative chamber, but such analogies gravely distort the facts; the iduhu kwarana was neither a political authority nor a priest, he was simply the senior elder (primus  inter pares) whose ritual associations and worldly opinions were entitled to special respect. There was no political machinery, and there were no formal sanctions."" (Groves, 2011, pp. 80-81)",groves-2011[80-81]

‘Population: Pressure and distribution’ (Baltaxe, 1975, pp. 33-61)

‘Traditional histories or Rarotonga’ (Baltaxe, 1975, pp. 62-96)

“We can define a corporate title as one which has immediate reference to the leadership of a specific, kinship-based, landholding corporation … These groups were fundamentally bilateral but a strong residential restriction on membership combined with a general rule of virilocality to lend them an appearance of patrilineal organization … Such a group and no other could properly be called a ngati in traditional terms.

“We will see later that particular genealogical relationships provided the basis for membership in a ngati but that the position of a specific individual within his ngati depended to a very large degree on his own personal capabilities, subject to an essentially political evaluation of the quality of his participation as well as the weight of his genealogical connections. While succession to a corporate title was in principle hereditary, ideally passing from father to eldest son, the specific person to fill such a position had to be confirmed by some immediate political process: election by the other ranking members of the corporation, military prowess hence power, or some other demonstration of mana, the recognition of which was the ultimate sanction and basis for leadership … [11] … There were two types of corporate title on Rarotonga before the end of the last century, ariki and mataiapo. One of the main tasks of this paper will be to establish the exact relationship between these two titles, but it appears that, until recently, there was little difference between them in practical terms. The mataiapo title appears to me to be basic, while the ariki is putatively senior mataiapo who is at the head of a confederation of related and contiguous ngati which comprise a vaka, usually translated as ‘tribe’. Thus the ariki was traditionally primus inter pares among the military and political leadership of the vaka, and he maintained that position by a series of marriage and adoptive alliances which supported his claims to genealogical seniority.

“But not all of the traditional titles were corporate as I have defined the term. At the beginning of the period to be covered by this study, the rangatira appears to have been a functionally defined status with an eligibility criterion of close, consanguineal relationship to the leader of some corporation, either an ariki or a mataiapo, as the case may be. Each rangatira was directly subordinate to a specific title of either rank.” (Baltaxe, 1975, pp. 10-11)

“The Ara Metua, more properly called Te Ara Nui A Toi, the Great Road of Toi, is the major archaeological feature of the island and its size and complex con-[48] struction have attracted a great deal of attention from those European scholars concerned with pre-contact Rarotonga … Both of these passages describe the skeleton of the Ara Metua, its remains some sixty or ninety years after the construction of the modern coastal road at the insistence of the early missionaries. On the other hand, John Williams certainly saw the Ara Metua in very much its pre-European contact state, describing it as ‘… a good road around the island …’ which required and received extensive care … [49] … These passages raise a number of important issues, among them the problems of determining the nature and locations of the settlements along the Ara Metua … In spite of the statement quotes [sic] above, the archaeological surveys of Rarotonga to which we have been referring in the past several pages show that there is actually no evidence of the existence of nucleated villages in the coastal area …. [50] … Presumably, the houses along the Ara Metua were clustered to some degree around the marae which were linked by that road, this in turn reflecting some of the major social ties of the inhabitants of the territorial units containing those marae.

“Such clustering could easily give an outsider an impression of discrete, although dispersed, villages, clearly separated geographically and possessing individual names, hence corporate identities. The references in the early ethnographic literature, such as those cited above, to ‘villages’ on Rarotonga at or before the time of European contact merely express that impression and should not be taken as referring to residential units per se. The primary factors governing residential location most likely were claims to, and competition for, land, access to a variety of resources within a relatively small area and, ultimately, security of occupation in the face of the threat of attack from neighbouring districts. All of these would have been most directly related to membership in the groups inhabiting the territorial units known as tapere.” (Baltaxe, 1975, pp. 47-50)

""A tapere is often named by reference to a specific group of people who are said to be living on that land by virtue of 'blood right'. This group is itself referred to by the term ngati followed by the name of the title at its head ..."" (Baltaxe, 1975, p. 60)

“The largest divisions in the society at the time of European contact were called vaka, literally the canoes of two individuals, Tangiia and Karika, who arrived at the island in about the thirteenth century. The vaka were consciously [63] organized political alliances of smaller, autonomous units, occupying specific tapere and led by people holding mataiapo and ariki titles. Thus the composition of the vaka can best be understood in terms of the deliberate analogy with the crew of a canoe in spite of the idiom of common consanguineal connections between all of its members; such connections, when they did exist were the result of later marriages among members of the component ngati … The distinction between, the ranks of ariki and mataiapo which has been so strongly emphasized by most European writers and government officials appears to have been much less clearly drawn before European contact than it was during the 19th century. While the exact nature of that relationship is still problematical, the significant distinction which appears in these traditional histories seems to separate the independent, corporate titles from the dependent, personal titles of komono and rangatira. The untitled people, the unga, hardly figure in these traditional narratives at all.” (Baltaxe, 1975, pp. 62-63)

“Nowhere in these narratives is there an explicit statement of any prerogatives of the ariki which the mataiapo did not also share. Thus the picture which emerges is one of the ariki as primus inter pares among the mataiapo, in spite of the tendency of Europeans to attribute royalty and special authority to them.” (Baltaxe, 1975, p. 76)","baltaxe-1975[1-18, 33-96]"

19063,nage,85,1,151-1,"“In order to erect a peo, a named clan (or any other aggregate of houses) must comprise at least two houses having the status of cult houses. Of these, the senior is specified as the house of the ‘trunk rider’ (saka pu’u), and the junior, represented as the first to have branched off, is the house of the ‘tip rider’ (saka lobo) … As the leader of the group (clan or group of houses) that owns a forked post, the trunk rider is the ‘possessor of the peo’ (moi peo) in the most specific sense, although both trunk rider and tip rider together can be specified indiscriminately as moi peo. In other ways as well, the two functionaries are closely identified with the post … The pairing of trunk rider and tip rider, the latter described as the ‘younger sibling’ (azi) and sometimes as the deputy or surrogate of the former, provides one of the numerous instances of dualism in Nage social and ceremonial order. It should be stressed, however, that the two Nage statuses do not divide temporal and spiritual (or religious) leadership in the way characteristic of diarchic systems found for example on Timor and Sumba. In fact, in most respects the two positions, although clearly related hierarchically and in a way involving the encompassment of one status by the other, are represented as functionally identical rather than complementary. In themselves, both statuses pertain to ceremony rather than politics. Yet formally at least, the trunk rider, closely supported by the tip rider, is recognized as leader of the collectivity associated with the peo post, in all spheres of life.” (Forth, 1998, p. 9)

“The trunk rider, as well as the tup rider and several other named functionaries connected with peo rituals are the foremost among the class of leaders Nage designate as mosa laki ... Formally speaking, only men of mosa laki rank may contribute buffalo for sacrifice, although this rule is somewhat relaxed at present ... As I later show, the mosa laki – or leader of high rank – is further opposed to a type of social person (and indeed as a social ideal) to varieties of mystical practitioner called toa mali. The opposition between these two, which somewhat recalls but does not actually constitute a diarchic division of spiritual and temporal authority, is most clearly expressed, moreover in their differential relation to spiritual beings, particularly as this is manifest in the context of buffalo sacrificing and other activities focussed upon the forked peo post.” (Forth, 1998, p. 15)

""In their different ways, both priests and toa mali contrast with ata ta'a hitu, women who occasionally fall into an uncontrolled trance (see Forth 1991c). Although in no sense functionaries, trancers nevertheless resemble priests in their positive dealings with spirits of the dead, while like toa mali they sometimes confront and counteract witches. Yet none of these three statuses can properly be called an office. This circumstance points to an absence of formal spiritual or religious authority among Nage. Certainly, there is none that is mutually exclusive or complementary with positions of political, or worldly, authority ...  The only positions that could accurately be called offices among Nage are the series connected with the peo post, which are mostly operative when a new post is obtained and carried into the village. Among these, the most important by far are the positions of 'trunk rider' (saka pu'u) and 'tip rider' (saka lobo).

""In accordance with the fact that the two 'riders' do not divide spiritual and worldly functions or powers, the saka pu'u, or trunk rider, is the one recognized as the general leader of the group that owns the peo, the person whose word carries the most weight in all corporate affairs, whether 'secular' or 'religious'.

19062,nage,84,2,149-2,"‘An overview of Nage social and ceremonial organization’ (pp. 5-18)

“Possessing a ‘head’ (ulu) and a ‘tail’ (eko), Nage villages (bo’a) are oriented to Ebu Lobo, the head end always pointing towards the volcano. With certain qualifications, these rectangular villages, usually consisting of two rows of houses (sa’o) faving opposite across an open village plaza (nata) are the more inclusive political and territorial units known to Nage. Village houses are divided among groups named woe, which hereafter I call ‘clans’. At present in the Bo’a Wae region, a village usually includes members of two or more clans, while in the past single clan villages appear to have been more common. Like villages, clans are named. The fact that often they bear the same name as a settlement in which they were formerly resident suggests indeed that clan names have regularly been derived from village names.

“Among the western Nage, persons belonging to a single clan usually occupy two or more villages. People of the same clan resident in different villages commonly assist one another in various tasks, including the amassing of bridewealth. The groups that own and corporately administer land, however, are not usually whole clans but component ‘houses’, and especially houses whose independence has been formalized by their achieving the status of what I call a ‘cult house’ … Built of special materials, and constructed to the accompaniment of numerous sacrifices and other rites, a cult house serves as the ceremonial and political centre of what may be called a ‘segment’ of a clan. Being linked with individual male ancestors of just a few generations’ remove, the associated lineal groups – the ones that can unequivocally claim to possess such houses – are usually not large … Matters are however, rather more complex than this may suggest. For any given time by no means all members of a clan (woe) will formally possess a ‘cult house’, which in a more general vein, the issue of cult house affiliation is subject to shifting, situational interpretations. What counts as a ‘house’ in general – a term that must be understood in a social sense, [7] since it does not always refer to a single physical building – is similarly variable, even though Nage regularly speak of ‘houses’ (including ‘cult houses’) as though they were units of asymmetric marriage alliance … While ‘clans’ might be spoken of as collections of related ‘houses’, therefore, the latter do not constitute identical segments precisely defined in terms of lineal depth or possessing equal ritual status. Indeed, it is doubtful how far a ‘clan’ can properly be called a descent group at all. All I discuss later on … Nage use the term woe as a reference to a ceremonial, especially sacrificial, co-operative at least as much as to a genealogical entity. Membership of houses, and hence of clans, is preferentially patrilineal inasmuch as it is preferred that a man pay bridewealth, thereby effecting the incorporation of children into his own group. If bridewealth is not fully paid, children are claimed by the mother’s natal group, or, in some circumstances, divided between the two groups. Where no bridewealth is given, moreover, the husband can be required to reside uxorilocally … Although regarded as a major index of Nage ethnicity, forked sacrificial posts (peo) are found only in a small number of prominent villages … Sometimes, a number of houses belonging to two or more different clans are recognized as the collective owners of such a post; and all then claim the right to sacrifice buffalo there. Even so, Nage commonly speak of a single clan (woe) exclusively owning a peo post as the natural arrangement, while expressing puzzlement as to how two or more clans could even have come to possess a peo jointly (Forth 1989a). Part of the answer seems to be that such groups once shared a common village, and in the past may even have been considered as forming a single woe.” (Forth, 1998, pp. 5-7)

“In order to erect a peo, a named clan (or any other aggregate of houses) must comprise at least two houses having the status of cult houses. Of these, the senior is specified as the house of the ‘trunk rider’ (saka pu’u), and the junior, represented as the first to have branched off, is the house of the ‘tip rider’ (saka lobo) … As the leader of the group (clan or group of houses) that owns a forked post, the trunk rider is the ‘possessor of the peo’ (moi peo) in the most specific sense, although both trunk rider and tip rider together can be specified indiscriminately as moi peo. In other ways as well, the two functionaries are closely identified with the post … The pairing of trunk rider and tip rider, the latter described as the ‘younger sibling’ (azi) and sometimes as the deputy or surrogate of the former, provides one of the numerous instances of dualism in Nage social and ceremonial order. It should be stressed, however, that the two Nage statuses do not divide temporal and spiritual (or religious) leadership in the way characteristic of diarchic systems found for example on Timor and Sumba. In fact, in most respects the two positions, although clearly related hierarchically and in a way involving the encompassment of one status by the other, are represented as functionally identical rather than complementary. In themselves, both statuses pertain to ceremony rather than politics. Yet formally at least, the trunk rider, closely supported by the tip rider, is recognized as leader of the collectivity associated with the peo post, in all spheres of life.” (Forth, 1998, p. 9)

“The trunk rider, as well as the tup rider and several other named functionaries connected with peo rituals are the foremost among the class of leaders Nage designate as mosa laki … Since formally, speaking, Nage society admits just two ranks, the mosa laki, described in the national language as ‘nobles’ (‘bangsawan’) are exhaustively opposed to a class of slaves and hereditary retainers called ho’o … who are held to derive ultimately from war captives and thus to be originally non-Nage. Although debt slaves (ho’o so’i so) are distinct from captives and the descendants of captives, these too are outsiders inasmuch as they are required to separate from their own group and become totally obligated to their masters, at least until they are able to redeem themselves. Formally speaking, only men of mosa laki rank may contribute buffalo for sacrifice, although this rule is somewhat relaxed at present. 

“Marriage between the two ranks is formally proscribed. As I later show, the mosa laki – or leader of high rank – is further opposed to a type of social person (and indeed as a social ideal) to varieties of mystical practitioner called toa mali. The opposition between these two, which somewhat recalls but does not actually constitute a diarchic division of spiritual and temporal authority, is most clearly expressed, moreover in their differential relation to spiritual beings, particularly as this is manifest in the context of buffalo sacrificing and other activities focussed upon the forked peo post.” (Forth, 1998, p. 15)

""In their different ways, both priests and toa mali contrast with ata ta'a hitu, women who occasionally fall into an uncontrolled trance (see Forth 1991c). Although in no sense functionaries, trancers nevertheless resemble priests in their positive dealings with spirits of the dead, while like toa mali they sometimes confront and counteract witches. Yet none of these three statuses can properly be called an office. This circumstance points to an absence of formal spiritual or religious authority among Nage. Certainly, there is none that is mutually exclusive or complementary with positions of political, or worldly, authority ...  The only positions that could accurately be called offices among Nage are the series connected with the peo post, which are mostly operative when a new post is obtained and carried into the village. Among these, the most important by far are the positions of 'trunk rider' (saka pu'u) and 'tip rider' (saka lobo).

""In accordance with the fact that the two 'riders' do not divide spiritual and worldly functions or powers, the saka pu'u, or trunk rider, is the one recognized as the general leader of the group that owns the peo, the person whose word carries the most weight in all corporate affairs, whether 'secular' or 'religious'. (Forth, 1998, pp 281-282)","forth1981[5-18, 281-282]"

“The trunk rider, as well as the tup rider and several other named functionaries connected with peo rituals are the foremost among the class of leaders Nage designate as mosa laki … Since formally, speaking, Nage society admits just two ranks, the mosa laki, described in the national language as ‘nobles’ (‘bangsawan’) are exhaustively opposed to a class of slaves and hereditary retainers called ho’o … who are held to derive ultimately from war captives and thus to be originally non-Nage. Although debt slaves (ho’o so’i so) are distinct from captives and the descendants of captives, these too are outsiders inasmuch as they are required to separate from their own group and become totally obligated to their masters, at least until they are able to redeem themselves. Formally speaking, only men of mosa laki rank may contribute buffalo for sacrifice, although this rule is somewhat relaxed at present. 

“Marriage between the two ranks is formally proscribed. As I later show, the mosa laki – or leader of high rank – is further opposed to a type of social person (and indeed as a social ideal) to varieties of mystical practitioner called toa mali. The opposition between these two, which somewhat recalls but does not actually constitute a diarchic division of spiritual and temporal authority, is most clearly expressed, moreover in their differential relation to spiritual beings, particularly as this is manifest in the context of buffalo sacrificing and other activities focussed upon the forked peo post.” (Forth, 1998, p. 15)",forth1998[5-18]

'Intellectual culture' (Nevermann, 2010, pp. 170-177)

'Feasts' (Nevermann, 2010, pp. 177-178)

'Social organization; (Chinnery, 1928, pp. 111-132)

'Magic and religion' (Chinnery, 1928, pp. 157-162)

Two kinds of religious specialists are mentioned in the sources - various kinds of magician (described both by Chinnery and Nevermann) and spirit mediums (described only by Chinnery). Neither appear to have occupied any formal 'office'.

'Sun sorcerers' (aitako - 'sun magicians' would seem to be a more accurate translation) are the only religious specialists that Nevermann describes in detail. According to Nevermann there was usually only one aitako in each district, but not necessarily. Also, there were conflicting reports about the identity of the sun sorcerer(s) in one district. The power of the aitako appears to have been person rather than institutional - the 'sun stones' through which they controlled the weather ceased to be effective upon his death.

“Magic with sun stones (atu sinak) is practiced to induce the sun to cause the taro to thrive in their own gardens, or to make them shrivel in the heat in their enemies’ fields … Normally in each district there is only one sun sorcerer, aitako … who is at the same time the ‘preparer’ of the stone. The effectiveness of the stone ceases on his death. In Etalat the chief Ainemoria is regarded as the sun sorcerer, while in Enai it is Kirie, at in Elemakunaur Kealo. From other reports, three men, Rod, Tukurui, and Namaran, were skilled in sun-and rain magic in Elemakunaur. Wura kept one of the the Enai stones, the chief Labokorori the other. Eura’s house was on the beach facing the sunrise; when rain persisted for too long, Kirie buried Wura’s stone on the beach at sunrise, causing the sun to rise. Kirie carried Labokori’s stone to the spot where the sun was needed, for example in the taro fields, and buried it. The stone remained there until people no longer wanted the sun but needed rain instead. A rain charm often had to made [sic], for this to happen … If the Enai people wanted to cause harm to their enemies, Kirie took Labokorori’s stone into their territory secretly at night, and buried it on the path from Enai.” (Nevermann, 2010, p. 176)

Chinnery has this to say about the 'inheritance of magical knowledge':

""Magical knowledge is said to be handed down through the aloa [sister's son - p. 129] or failing a relative of this status, through the nearest a mali [clan - p. 114] connection. It may also be acquired through gift or by purchase from a practitioner with whom one is on terms of friendship."" (Chinnery, 1959, p. 159)

Spirit mediums are described as follows:

""In the olden days there were certain women who had the power to communicate with raroai and to acquire from their ghostly advisers useful information regarding the life and interests of the people ... [158] ...  Persons requiring advice were admitted into the hut, their questions were communicated to the raroai, and its whistling replies were interpreted by the operator ... The art was handed down from mother to daughter. I met one woman who had received part of the instruction, her mother having died before all the secrets were revealed. She gave me no details, but in a general way suggested that the preparation extended over a long period. It was marked by periods of fasting and forms of self-sacrifice. It included a knowledge of certain magical plants and a number of incantations, the words and sequence of which she has now forgotten."" (Chinnery, 1928, pp. 157-158)

Unlike in many Pacific Island societies, 'chiefs' do not appear to have played a 'priestly' role. They could be magicians (see Nevermann, 2010, p. 176 above) but there is no indication that this was one of the functions attached to their office. Their functions are described as follows:

“Every small village on St Matthias and Emir had its own chief, (bau), whose orders are carried out, generally without question. The least significant of these chiefs, furthermore, are [158] nothing more than a form of ‘oldest person’ on a farm, and there are even individual houses with their own bau … Bigger villages often have two chiefs side by side. This was the case in 1908 in Elukabiu, part of the village of Elemakunaur, where Makarinitan (Sagile), and Tuputeput were both chiefs. Makarinitan appeared to have the seniority. Any visits were made to him first. 

“The functions of these greater chiefs consist of dealing with other villages through their chiefs, leading the men in warfare, adjudicating between quarrelling subjects, receiving visitors to the village (to whom the bau first offers a chew of betel in the chief’s house), and arranging feasts."" (Nevermann, 2010, p. 158)

'Feasting' had a religious component, but appears to have occurred for largely secular reasons:

""Occasions for feasts are: conclusion of an alliance between two villages, visits from neighbours, settlement of major debts, preparation for war, and similar events. Not uncommonly, [178] feasts also seem to be improved, with greater emphasis on dancing than on the festive meal. That religious moments also play a major role in feasts is demonstrated by dance sticks with images of the dead, and probably also by the bird-shaped dance accessories, (sinaku).""

A longer description of the role of the shaman is provided by Vanoverbergh (1953, 1954). Shamans quite clearly occupied an office in that they were clearly marked off from the rest of the population (they needed to be formally consecrated in order to practice) and had exclusive rights and duties:

""To be considered a dorarákit, it is sufficient for a woman to have been consecrated  by another shaman, but such a consecration is absolutely required."" (Vanoverbergh, 1953, p. 557)

""The functions of a dorarákit are numerous and varied. She determines, chooses, collects and distributes the tánib or amulets, which play such an important rôle in the life of an Isneg, although not all of these come under the jurisdiction of a single shaman. She is the universally accepted physician and surgeon in all kinds of sickness, and her activities are not confined to specialities, whether in the field of diagnosing disease or in that of treatments to effect their cure, as has been amply proved in my paper on Isneg ailments. She plays a preponderant rôle in all public sacrifices, whether sãy-ám or pildáp, as will be explained in a subsequent article. But her most outstanding function is the maxanito.  Whenever a dorarákit performs the maxanito, she becomes mataiyan, i.e. possessed either by a spirit or by the kaduduwa of a deceased person …"" (Vanoverbergh, 1953, p. 559)

However, the shaman does not appear to have had a defined sphere in which she operated. One shaman’s ‘fame’ [was] spread  all over the country’ (Vanoverbergh, 1953, p. 560), suggested that there was in theory no limit to a given shaman’s sphere of operations. Furthermore, the public sacrifices at which shamans officiated were sponsored by individual households and included individuals from far and wide (Vanoverbergh, 1954).  

The mengal (renowned headhunter) also played a religious role, but similar case as above:

""Vanoverbergh points out, in a description of Isneg rituals, that where the [8] focus of ceremonies among the wet-terracing peoples is upon sacrificing of pigs for haruspication, the Isneg make headtaking the nuclear concern. At major festivals, individuals of mengal status have opportunity to recite their deeds, dance, and participate in exclusive rites such as chanting in a circle while beating with decorated bamboo poles on a stone – called by Vanoverbergh ‘the most solemn act of veneration for the anito (spirits) … A man who starts a fight or takes a head cannot get any kudos unless he makes the fact public. In ‘confessing,’ as informants called it, he is obligated to assemble hamlet fellows and kinsmen so that he can rally their aid and warn them of an expected retaliation by the offended parties who will soon hear of his boasting. The security rights of the group are thus deeply involved in any personal ventures of this kind. Moreover, for such a gathering to take place, the killer or his group must be able to provide appropriate quantities of food, wine, livestock, and ceremonial wealth for distribution to mengal status persons and women shamans who conduct required ritual …A man who starts a fight or takes a head cannot get any kudos unless he makes the fact public.

(Keesing, 1962, pp. 7-8)

""Isneg value patterns, as seen in the spheres of wealth and bravery, emphasis upon individual achievement. This individualism, combined smallness of settlement units, left less scope than among most other peoples for the development of formally structured authority… Leadership in the Isneg society is diffuse. Beyond the household and immediate kin it is concerned with reputation and influence rather than real power.

""Even so, informants asked about leadership matters almost invariably first of great mengal figures of past and present whose influence extended over large regions, and whose fame went further … [10] … A rising mengal finds himself and others in neighboring hamlets consulting him on intergroup affairs, and he may be called on to arbitrate disputes and otherwise take leadership. He attracts and distributes important wealth, and his home becomes a center for festivals and rituals. He becomes imbued with spiritual potency which makes him both respected and feared. Vanoverbergh cites the supernatural penalties incurred by a person who cuts or notches, even accidentally, ‘any part of the house’ of a mengal, his only rememdy being to sniff the magical pouch which the mengal carries on his person - something an enemy could hardly do while the houseowner was alive.""

""When chieftainship flourished in the island there were several districts, each with its high chief, Fano, who had jurisdiction overall the villages in his territory, while each village had its own Fanlo as well, who had local authority ... The word Fanlo seems to mean a man of the chiefly class and is not the special title of the high chief ... [133] ... The authority of the high chief was absolute in the old days. He held councils and asked the advice of the old men of his district, though only those of the Fanlo were invited to air their views, and frank opinions were expressed and extreme divergences of opinion thrashed out. The final decision was with the high chief ... Judgement and punishment were meted out to the offenders if the matter required it; and if it was a question of warfare the decision for or against rested in the hands of the high chief.""

This was the case in 1908 in Elukabiu, part of the village of Elemakunaur, where Makarinitan (Sagile), and Tuputeput were both chiefs. Makarinitan appeared to have the seniority. Any visits were made to him first. 

“The functions of these greater chiefs consist of dealing with other villages through their chiefs, leading the men in warfare, adjudicating between quarrelling subjects, receiving visitors to the village (to whom the bau first offers a chew of betel in the chief’s house), and arranging feast. “ (Nevermann, 2010, p. 158)",nevermann-2010[158]

21160,rarotonga,85,2,151-2,"‘Introduction’ (Baltaxe, 1975, pp. 1-18)

‘Population: Pressure and distribution’ (Baltaxe, 1975, pp. 33-61)

‘Traditional histories or Rarotonga’ (Baltaxe, 1975, pp. 62-96)

Settlement of Rarotonga was dispersed within land units called tapere:

“The Ara Metua, more properly called Te Ara Nui A Toi, the Great Road of Toi, is the major archaeological feature of the island and its size and complex con-[48] struction have attracted a great deal of attention from those European scholars concerned with pre-contact Rarotonga … Both of these passages describe the skeleton of the Ara Metua, its remains some sixty or ninety years after the construction of the modern coastal road at the insistence of the early missionaries. On the other hand, John Williams certainly saw the Ara Metua in very much its pre-European contact state, describing it as ‘… a good road around the island …’ which required and received extensive care … [49] … These passages raise a number of important issues, among them the problems of determining the nature and locations of the settlements along the Ara Metua … In spite of the statement quotes [sic] above, the archaeological surveys of Rarotonga to which we have been referring in the past several pages show that there is actually no evidence of the existence of nucleated villages in the coastal area …. [50] … Presumably, the houses along the Ara Metua were clustered to some degree around the marae which were linked by that road, this in turn reflecting some of the major social ties of the inhabitants of the territorial units containing those marae.

“Such clustering could easily give an outsider an impression of discrete, although dispersed, villages, clearly separated geographically and possessing individual names, hence corporate identities. The references in the early ethnographic literature, such as those cited above, to ‘villages’ on Rarotonga at or before the time of European contact merely express that impression and should not be taken as referring to residential units per se. The primary factors governing residential location most likely were claims to, and competition for, land, access to a variety of resources within a relatively small area and, ultimately, security of occupation in the face of the threat of attack from neighbouring districts. All of these would have been most directly related to membership in the groups inhabiting the territorial units known as tapere.” (Baltaxe, 1975, pp. 47-50)

Each tapere was occupied by a kin group called a ngati:

""A tapere is often named by reference to a specific group of people who are said to be living on that land by virtue of 'blood right'. This group is itself referred to by the term ngati followed by the name of the title at its head ..."" (Baltaxe, 1975, p. 60)

Each ngati was led by mataiapo or ariki, and was part of a larger unit called the vaka. Each vaka was nominally led by an ariki, whose position among the mataiapo, however, is described as 'primus inter pares':

“We can define a corporate title as one which has immediate reference to the leadership of a specific, kinship-based, landholding corporation … These groups were fundamentally bilateral but a strong residential restriction on membership combined with a general rule of virilocality to lend them an appearance of patrilineal organization … Such a group and no other could properly be called a ngati in traditional terms.

“We will see later that particular genealogical relationships provided the basis for membership in a ngati but that the position of a specific individual within his ngati depended to a very large degree on his own personal capabilities, subject to an essentially political evaluation of the quality of his participation as well as the weight of his genealogical connections. While succession to a corporate title was in principle hereditary, ideally passing from father to eldest son, the specific person to fill such a position had to be confirmed by some immediate political process: election by the other ranking members of the corporation, military prowess hence power, or some other demonstration of mana, the recognition of which was the ultimate sanction and basis for leadership … [11] … There were two types of corporate title on Rarotonga before the end of the last century, ariki and mataiapo. One of the main tasks of this paper will be to establish the exact relationship between these two titles, but it appears that, until recently, there was little difference between them in practical terms. The mataiapo title appears to me to be basic, while the ariki is putatively senior mataiapo who is at the head of a confederation of related and contiguous ngati which comprise a vaka, usually translated as ‘tribe’. Thus the ariki was traditionally primus inter pares among the military and political leadership of the vaka, and he maintained that position by a series of marriage and adoptive alliances which supported his claims to genealogical seniority.

“But not all of the traditional titles were corporate as I have defined the term. At the beginning of the period to be covered by this study, the rangatira appears to have been a functionally defined status with an eligibility criterion of close, consanguineal relationship to the leader of some corporation, either an ariki or a mataiapo, as the case may be. Each rangatira was directly subordinate to a specific title of either rank.” (Baltaxe, 1975, pp. 10-11)

“The largest divisions in the society at the time of European contact were called vaka, literally the canoes of two individuals, Tangiia and Karika, who arrived at the island in about the thirteenth century. The vaka were consciously [63] organized political alliances of smaller, autonomous units, occupying specific tapere and led by people holding mataiapo and ariki titles. Thus the composition of the vaka can best be understood in terms of the deliberate analogy with the crew of a canoe in spite of the idiom of common consanguineal connections between all of its members; such connections, when they did exist were the result of later marriages among members of the component ngati … The distinction between, the ranks of ariki and mataiapo which has been so strongly emphasized by most European writers and government officials appears to have been much less clearly drawn before European contact than it was during the 19th century. While the exact nature of that relationship is still problematical, the significant distinction which appears in these traditional histories seems to separate the independent, corporate titles from the dependent, personal titles of komono and rangatira. The untitled people, the unga, hardly figure in these traditional narratives at all.” (Baltaxe, 1975, pp. 62-63)

Each vaka had a 'high priest', ta'unga. It is not clear that mataiapo or ariki had any specifically religious role, but the ariki clearly enjoyed at least formal superiority over the ta'unga:

“Te Ariki Taraare’s knowledge was not surprising since he ‘was the last of the high priests (ta’unga) of Rarotonga. His family have borne that name for some twenty generations and they have always performed the function of anointing and consecrating the [Makea] Ariki … at the sacred marae of Arai-te-tonga’ (Smith in Te Ariki Taraare 1899:61).

“Another major source was More Taunga-o-te-tini, who provided many of the stories and notes translated by Stephen Savage. More was ‘a descendant of the high priest More-moate and also of another high priest named Maoate-atua, both of whom joined Tangiia-nui’s expedition when [he] was fleeing from his cousin [and adoptive as well as classificatory brother], Tutapu. The More of that period came onto Rarotonga with Tangiia, as one of his high priests and was afterwards placed under the jurisdiction of Pa-ariki (Te Ariki Upokotini) and Motoro (Te Ariki Tinomana) by Tangiia-Nui, and was given certain priestly offices to perform …’ (Savage 1910:143).

“The apparent contradiction concerning Te Ariki Taraare’s status as the ‘last of the high priests of Rarotonga’ is easily resolved. Smith has assumed that the ta’unga’s special relationship to Makea, and his officiating at the marae at Arai-te-tonga, conferred on him a position analogous to Makea’s ‘royal’ supremacy over the island. Since the latter’s position was largely a European creation, the assumption naturally was false, but it does seem to have set a precedent for describing the ta’unga charged with special duties vis-à-vis an ariki as a ‘high priest’.” (Baltaxe, 1975, p. 68)","baltaxe-1975[1-18, 33-96]"

The Chuukese lived in ‘hamlets’ that were often, but not always, coterminous with ‘districts’:

""Settlements were not densely clustered. Rather, a local community consisted of a number of extended family households scattered in isolation or in small clusters over suitable lands to which the households had access. The resulting hamlets were connected by footpaths; and a main path tended to go around, or part way around, an island parallel to and a little way back from the shore, where the higher ground begins, linking its several communities together."" (Goodenough, 2002, p 23)

""Local residential communities of people sharing their lives as neighbours often were contained within the boundaries of a single district. Here and there, however, and from time to time, a community might involve two or more [43] districts together. By marrying back and forth, the members of the various lineages came to have holdings in the several districts. The chief of one could owe first fruits to the chief of another and vice versa … In such a situation, the several households in the community might be distributed over lands in the several neighbouring districts or they might be concentrated on lands within one of them … In any case, a community, whether it was coterminous with a district or included more than one, was a group of lineages that married back and forth among one another and that were held together, therefore, by a network of overlapping kinship ties.""(Goodenough, 2002, pp 42-43)

Each district had a ‘chiefly lineage’ headed by a ‘chief’:

""Each distinct region of space formed a district or ‘division of the land’ (sópwun fénú), and the senior male member of the lineage that held title to the space was the district chief (sómwoonun sóópw or sómwoonun fénú)."" (Goodenough, 2002, p 31)

Most chiefly activity described by Goodenough is confined to the district level, though some chiefs were recognized in two or three districts:

""Following the defeat of one district by another, members of the chiefly lineage in the victorious district might take up residence in the defeated district, taking over for themselves the plots of soil that had been held by the defeated chiefly lineage. They functioned locally as the new chiefly lineage, but they remained  a junior line within the larger super lineage that now held the space in both districts and therefore wielded the chiefship in both. The new local chief of the defeated district was expected to render first fruits on behalf of his entire district to the head of the senior line in the victorious district. In this way, for example, early in the nineteenth century, the chiefly lineage of Núkúnúféw District on Wútéét (Udot) Island won overlordship of Peniya District and over the whole of Romónum Island, which comprised another district."" (Goodenough, 2002, pp 37-38)

Functions of the district chief:

""At the time, the powers of chiefs, as such, in community affairs [299] were limited (Krämer 1932: 267, 272). They had the right to impose temporary taboos on the harvesting of certain foods in order to conserve supplies as custodians of their people’s welfare. They also had the right to call upon their people to contribute food to public gatherings and feasts. But they made no laws and, with one exception, they did not serve as judges over offenses. They sought, with the help of itang, to encourage peace and harmony among their constituents and to reconcile feuding lineages; they preached to the people that it was wrong to steal and sleep with other men’s wives; but their authority in this regard flowed from the respect they enjoyed by virtue of their command of itang lore and their recognized legitimacy as rightful holders of chiefly office … A chief did preside, however, over his district’s sitting in judgement when someone had offended against the work of the breadfruit summoner, in the event the chief had paid to have the ritual performed on behalf of all the lineages in his district. Such offense was seen as against the district as a whole."" (Goodenough, 2002, pp 298-299)

‘Leagues’ consisting of many districts also existed, and are described as having been led by the ‘most powerful chiefs and districts’ (presumably this means that they were led by the chiefs of the most powerful districts):

""Quite apart from conquests of this kind were major interdistrict leagues, under the leadership of the most powerful chiefs and districts. In the nineteenth century, all of Chuuk, except for Wuumaan and the northern districts of Wééné, was divided into two great leagues that were pitted against each other in political and military rivalry. The leagues went by the names of the body of war rituals controlled by the particular schools of political priests (itang) that were headquartered on Wééné (Moen) and Feefen Islands. The league based on Wééné was called Máchewen Sópwunupi … An old district on Wééné named Iras … was by tradition the highest ranking district in the league … The league based on Feefen and its school of itang were called Mácheweyi-Chchún … Fóóngen on Feefen was the highest ranking district in that league. These leagues were chronically at war."" (Goodenough, 2002, p 38)

The only communal activity engaged in by the leagues appears to have been war. Itang ('political priests') were considered ideal war leaders, though chiefs could also serve in this role. Both chiefs and high-ranking itang belonged to 'chiefly lineages', so leadership of the leagues could be seen as vested in lineages rather than individuals.

""Chiefs might serve as war leaders, but it was preferable for an itang (political priest) to be leader (Krämer 1932:266; Efot 1947). If a chief led, his followers were more liable to be killed than if an itang led, because the latter knew the more powerful rituals and spells for protecting combatants from injury. Itang renowned for their achievements as war leaders were sought as allies."" (Goodenough, 2002, p 275)

""Aside from the chief, a district’s military leader was the senior itang (political priest) who in many respects outranked the district chief. It was the itang who performed the principal rites to ensure military success. It was he who decided, through divination, on the manner of attack. He indicated who would go in what canoe on a military expedition. Anyone violating his orders was liable to die in the ensuing battle."" (Goodenough, 2002, p 277)

""Chuuk’s itang were not formally organized as a professional group. Those who were knowledgeable taught their sons and their sister's sons, occasionally also their sister's husbands and their daughters to hold in trust for their children. Itang did not meet with other itang outside their kinship circle to exchange secrets and share what they knew. (Eiue 1947).

""Interdistrict dealings between chiefs and itang, however, required shared knowledge of a secret message system. A basket (chúúk) would be sent to the chief or itang in a neighbouring district. In it tobacco leaves were placed on top of an object of value ... The type of object conveyed the message, such as ‘there is war, come to help us.’ The chief or itang receiving the basket would open up what appeared to be a gift of tobacco and then announce some news to the mystification of the uninitiated (Kekin 1947)."" (Goodenough, 2002, p 302)

“Knowledge of itang was confined to members of chiefly lineages and to the children and descendants of chiefs. Ideally, chiefs themselves were expected to have such knowledge, but often there were other members of their lineage who were more proficient in it. More importantly, chiefly lineages of the Sópwunupi clan or of its clan offshoots were considered those most entitled to the knowledge and to be more knowledgeable, and hence more powerful in the use of that knowledge, than others who might also claim to know itang.

“Those with such knowledge who were in the direct line of transmission – members of the founding clan or in the direct line of descent through males from that clan – were chóóyiro (‘people of the arc’) … Mwáániireeto ‘men of near persons’) were eldest among a set of lineage brothers knowing itang. The younger brothers, mwáániireenó (‘men of far persons’) had to defer to their eldest brothers, or the eldest among them who was present, and not display their knowledge in speeches at public meetings without proper indications of deference … Among chóóyiro, there were recognized grades of knowledge (Efot 1947). At the highest level was the itangúpwpwún (‘dirt itang’), presumably so called because of his power to make an ordinary person ill when chewing red earth by simply addressing words directly at him. It took about two years of schooling to achieve the highest level of knowledge required to be an itangúpwpwún … [305] … Those who had acquired knowledge of itang but who were not in the direct line of descent (who were not chóóyiro) were aché or achéémaaraw (‘payment makers’ or ‘unripe payment makers’). They might include a sister’s husband of an itang, married into the chiefly lineage, who had been taught the lore so he could pass it on to his children in that lineage, or to an itang’s wife’s brother, who would teach it to his sister’s sons, the itang’s children. Some women in the line of descent were also taught itang lore. They could not practice as itang, but they could hold the knowledge in trust for their children.

“More numerous among the ache were the purchasers (as the term implies) of itang knowledge and their descendants. For an itang to reveal the special meanings of itang talk to someone not eligible by descent to learn it would result in his own or his sister’s son’s death, unless appropriate payment was made … Lineages of clans that were not in the direct line of descent often gained a district chiefship through war or through succession as ‘children’ of a chiefly line that had died out. To validate their chiefly position it was essential for them to acquire knowledge of itang … Lineages needing to acquire such knowledge did so by paying a sizeable tuition to an itang to teach them. An aché was [306] not entitled to make a public display of his knowledge in the presence of a chóóyiro. It was also understood that aché did not ordinarily have the same depth of knowledge as the highest grade of chóóyiro. (Boutau 1965).

“The two great political leagues under the aegis of the itang schools of Máchewen Sópwunupi and Mácheweyi-Chchún were thus comprised of [sic] districts with chiefly lineages in the senior line of descent (the highest ranking) and chiefly lineages in the senior line of descent (the highest ranking) and chiefly lineages in junior lines of descent – all of them chóóyiro, ‘people of the arc [of heaven]’ – together with districts whose chiefly lineages had knowledge of their school of itang as aché (purchasers).” (Goodenough, 2002, pp. 304-306)","goodenough2002[29-46, 273-320]"

'Lösi' (Guiart, 1963, pp. 478-544)

There were three 'chiefdoms' or 'districts' on Lifou: Weṭ, Gaiča, and Lösi. 

All three consisted of multiple villages:

« La disposition des villages de Weṭ, autour de la plaine de Wanaham, et l’evolution particulière de leur organisation, à tous les nivaux, permet d’adopter ici pour l’exposé un plan fonctionnel. » (Guiart, 1963, p. 352)

(The arrangement of the villages of Weṭ, around the plain of Wanaham, and the particular evolution of their organization, at all levels, makes it possible for us to present here a functional plan.)

« Le district de Gaiča, district central, est le moins étendu en superficie. Le plus faiblement peupléaussi, puisqu’il ne comprenait que 1 162 habitants en 1954, répartis en quatre villages. » (Guiart, 1963, p. 455)

List of the thirteen villages of Lösi: Guiart (1963, p. 538)

The supernatural wellbeing of Weṭ was in the hands of a group called the Atesi:

« Les Anga atesi (ou Angatesi) beneficent, à Wet, d’une prestige et un status aussi mal défini qui’il apparaît important à première vue. Les atesi de Lifou sont un peu <la tarte à la crême> des descriptions fragmentairs publiées jusqu’à present, le role qu’on leur attribute variant, suivant le cas, de sorcier à celui de conseiller suprême détrônent à volonté les grands chefs. Le regretté Medecin-Capitaine Fagot, tout en nous expliquant correctement l’origine du terme atesi (de ate sine ite haze, hommes d’essence divine), a verse dans ce défaut, comme d’ailleurs les rares publications missionaries. Nous avons vu comment le myth accorde, pour les changements politiques, le role principal àIdhez et Wawalahae, sans qu’il soit question de Waleweny et des autres atesi.

« Si l’on tente de serrer le problème de plus près, on s’aperçoit qu’à Waleweny et Hwenegei est attribué le role de protection magique de la chefferie, par l’intermédaire de leurs subjects, maîtres de la terre, qui seuls peuvent prévaloir de la possession de haze, et pour cela sont dits tene haze. Ils pouraient évidement, en théorie, retirer cette protection, ce que qui permettrait aux influences contradictoires de jouer, l’équilibre précaire constituent la chefferie de Wet étant alors rompu. C’est en ce sens seulement qu’on leur attribute le pouvoir de deposer le grand chef. Considérés comme les <pères> du grand chef, ils auraient seuls le droit de lui appliquer des sanctions corporelles. Ce droit, reconnu en principle, paraît, en fait, n’avoir jamais été appliqué.

[374]

« Les atesi ne doivent d’autre hommage au grand chef qu’un present de bonne volonté, ou sithingen. Leur fonction permanente est la surveillance de la chefferie, tant afin d’empêcher toute chose pernicieuse venant de l’extérieur, que pour s’opposer àla volonté du grand chef s’ils sont désaccord avec lui. Les grands chefs successifs, que ce soit au moment de la christianisation ou à celui de la prise de possession, ne se sont jamais heurtés de front aux atesi, mais ont utilisédes moyens obliques, attirant la mission catholique, puis l’administration française, pour arriver à leurs fins et tenter d’assurer une authorité aussi absolute que possible sur leur sujets frondeurs, et convertis au christianisme réformé.
On sait que les principaux atesi sont au nombre de quatre: Waixaca à Easo, Hwenegei à Hanawa, Waleweny à Saint-Paul, Isamato à Nathalo.

« De ces quatres grands, WALEWENY serait le principal. Son nom signifie l’arc-en-ciel. On sait son role de la conversion du Wet. Cette volonté, affirmée il y a un siècle, d’être le leader spirituel de la communauté- comme auparavant il était le chef de tous les tene haze – se pursuit aujourd’hui avec le titulaire actuel de la charge, Hnaxeme, que l’on continue à appeler communément Walewene. Cette homme jeune s’est mis à la tête d’un mouvement à l’intérieur de l’église autochthone, mouvement don’t l’essentiel est la constitution des cercles de jeunes gens, et qui est destine à réveiller la conscience des membres d’églises sur le plan social. » (Guiart, 1963, pp. 373-374)

(""The Anga atesi (or Angatesi) enjoy, in Wet, a prestige and a status so ill-defined that it appears important at first glance. The atesi of Lifou are a bit of the ‘cream pie’ of the fragmentary descriptions published to date, the role attributed to them varying, as the case may be, from sorcerer to that that of supreme adviser, dethroning the great chiefs at will. The late Doctor-Captain Fagot, while correctly explaining the origin of the term atesi (de ate sine ite haze, men of divine essence), made this mistake, as did the rare missionary publications.  We have seen how the myth gives Idhez and Wawalahae the lead in political change, without mentioning Waleweny and the other atesi.

""If we take a closer look at the problem, we see that Waleweny and Hwenegei are assigned the role of magical protection of the chiefdom, through as representatives of their subjects, masters of the land, who alone can prevail over the possession of haze, and for this are called tene haze. They could obviously, in theory, remove this protection, which would allow adverse influences, the precarious balance constituting the chiefdom of Wet then being broken. It is only in this sense that they are given the power to depose the high chief. Considered as the ‘fathers’ of the great chief, they alone have the right to apply bodily sanctions to him. This right, recognized in principle, appears, in fact, never to have been applied.

""The atesi owe the great chief no other homage than a gift of goodwill, or sithingen. Their permanent function is the surveillance of the chiefdom, both in order to prevent any pernicious thing from outside, and to oppose the will of the grand chief if they disagree with him. The successive great chiefs, whether at the time of Christianization or at the time of colonisation, never clashed head-on with the atesi, but used oblique means, attracting the Catholic mission, then the French administration, to achieve their ends and try to ensure an authority as absolute as possible over their rebellious subjects, and converts to reformed Christianity.

""We known that there are four principal atesi: Waixaca at Easo, Hwenegei at Hanawa, Waleweny at Saint-Paul, and Isamato at Nathalo.

""Of these four great ones, WALEWENY is the principal one. His name means rainbow. We know his role in the conversion of Wet. This desire, affirmed a century ago, to be the spiritual leader of the community - as before he was the leader of all the tene haze - continues today with the current holder of the office, Hnaxeme, as the we continue to commonly call Walewene. This young man has put himself at the head of a movement within the autochthonous church, a movement essentially constituted by circles of young people, and which is intended to awaken the conscience of the members. churches on the social level."")

Gaiča also had one or more atesi who seems to have played a religious role, while perhaps also holding secular power:

« Les récit transcrits ont donné déjà un aperçu de la function d’atesi, telle qu’elle était comprise à Gaiča. Il serait bien difficile, aujourd’hui, de préciser ces éléments ... Mexanang(ē) et Wahminya jouent d’ailleurs à la cour d’Alaxuten, pauvre en dignitaries, à la fois le role d’atesi et celui de sinelapa ... [462] ... MEXANANG(Ē) semble avoir été un personage plus important que Wahminya. Vacillant dans sa foi envers son haze, le thu de Isameč, il tenta l’introduction du dieu Finiwn, venu de Hunēdh, c’est-à-dire d’une dépendance directe de la chefferie Bula; Finiwan était d’ailleurs le haze de Hnamemè, atesi de Bula. Plus tard Mexanang(ē) fut, de la même façon, le responsible de l’introduction du christianisme réformé à Gaiča ... Le texte du pasteur Waṭe montre combine la function de Mexanang(ē) semble avoir été de tenir en tutelle Alaxuten et ses descendants. On conçoit les tensions permanentes produites, au sein de la structure de la chefferie, par cette attitude, même commandée par la tradition. Mexanang(ē) parle pour le chef et commande en son nom aux sinelapa, c’est-à-dire même à Wahminya; du moins sur le plan de la vie interne de la chefferie. » (Guiart, 1963, pp. 461-462)

(“The written accounts have already given an indication of the function of atesi as understood in Gaiča. It would be very difficult, today, to specify these elements … At the court of Alaxuten, poor in dignitaries, Mexanang(ē) and Wahminya play the roles of atesi and also of sinelapa [‘assistant’ or ‘deputy’] ...  MEXANANG(Ē) seems to have been a more important character than Wahminya. Wavering in his faith towards his haze [god], the thu of Isameč, he tried to introduce the god Finiwn, who came from Hunēdh, that is to say from a direct dependence of the Bula chiefdom; Finiwan was also the haze of Hnamemé, atesi of Bula. Later Mexanang(ē) was similarly responsible for bringing reformed Christianity to Gaiča ...  Pastor Waṭe’s text shows how the function of Mexanang(ē) seems to have been to keep Alaxuten and his descendants under guard. We can imagine the permanent tensions that this structure produced within the chiefdom, even though it was ordered by tradition. Mexanang(ē) speaks for the chief and commands in his name as sinelapa, that is, the same as Wahminya; at least in terms of the internal life of the chiefdom."")

Lösi had three atesi whose function was to 'protect' the district, presumably using magic:

« A cela s’ajoutent les atesi de Lösi, au nombre de trois: ČAEÉ, établi à Hmelèk, HNANEMÉ de Hunēdh et PIYA de Luèngöni. Aucun lien mythique n’apparaîtes réunir, au contraire de ce qui se passe à Weṭ. Effectivement, aucune solidarité visible ne semble s’être établi entre eux. Ils sont les protecteurs attitrés de la chefferie Bula, quant du moins ils ne lui sont pas rebelles. Cette ambivalence historique de leur function est ce qui les rapproche le plus de la situation faite à leurs collègues de Weṭ, les atesi i Ukeinesö. Le plus important de trois serait Čaeé. C’est aussie le plus éloigné geographiquement. Tous trois sont pourtant placés sur les routes menant à Mou, comme afin d’assurer la protection de la grande chefferie. » (Guiart, 1963, p. 540)

(""In addition, the atesi of Lösi number three: ČAEÉ, established at Hmelèk, HNANEMÉ of Hunēdh and PIYA of Luèngöni. No mythical link appears to unite them, unlike in Weṭ. Effectively, there seems to be no solidarity between them. They are the appointed protectors of the Bula chiefdom, at least as long as they do not rebel. The historical ambivalence of their function is what brings them closest to the situation faced by their colleagues at Weṭ, the atesi i Ukeinesö. The most important of the three is Čaeé. This is also the furthest geographically. However, all three are placed on the roads leading to Mou, as if to ensure the protection of the great chiefdom."")

Guiart also mentions two other figures who appear to have performed magico-religious functions for all of Lösi:

« KAČEČE est le garde du corps du grand chef, dont au surplus il assure la protection magique, grâce à son haze Čičiate, le martin-pêcheur. » (Guiart, 1963, p. 539)

(""KAČEČE is the bodyguard of the great chief, who in addition assures magical protection, granted by his haze Čičiate, the kingfisher."")

« Les magiciens de la pluie et du soleil, dits hune, ou tene, ḍay, agissant pour le compte du grand chef et de l’ensemble du district, sont les ANGETE ASE de Hunēdh et les ANGETE HMENU de Xode. » (Guiart, 1963, p. 540)

(""The rain and sun magicians, called hune, or tene, ḍay, acting on behalf of the high chief and the whole district, are the ANGETE ASE of Hunēdh and the ANGETE HMENU of Xode."")",guiart-1963[351-345]

17785,tagbanuwa,84,3,149-3,"'Religion and society' (Fox, 1982, pp. 145-247)

According to Fox there were five 'socio-religious' units among the Tagbanuwa: the individual, the nuclear family, the bilateral family, the village, and the Tagbanuwa as a whole:

""Looked at in another way, each individual Tagbanuwa is involved in varying degrees in five socio-religious systems. Each of these social units has by and large its own ritual behavior and obligations ... The five expanding units of coordinate religious and social activities which will form the working basis for the analysis of religion among the Tagbanua are as follows:

""(1) The individual as a 'social personality' who plays various roles in which ritual practices and social activities are interwoven ... [147] (2) The elementary family of the father, mother and children, the basic social unit of Tagbanuwa society, is linked religiously with the cult of the dead ... (3) The bilateral family and bilateral kindred are correlated with the complex diwata ceremony in which the babaylan is the principal functionary ... (4) The village or community is defined, in part, by its religious unity. Ceremonies such as the lambay formally embrace all of the inhabitants of a village. The members of the community are required by legal sanctions to participate in these village ceremonies.

""(5) Finally, there are pan-Tagbanwa ceremonies, such as the runsay, which are structured with a vague but growing concept of a Tagbanuwa 'nation'."" (Fox, 1982, pp 146-147). 

There appears to have been no religious authority at the nuclear family level, since anyone could perform the bilang ceremony. However, the pagdiwata ceremonies that were performed on behalf of the bilateral family required a babalyan:

""The babalyan have numerous duties and exert a considerable influence upon the everyday social activities of the people. They select ritually favorable clearings, placate environmental deities, interpret dreams, provide charms for hunting and fishing, and treat all types of serious illness. During the familial bilang ceremonies any adult can invoke the spirits of the dead. But the many deities which appear during the pagdiwata rituals can only be called by the babalyan. They are trained intermediaries who guide the interaction of the living with the deities as well as with the dead."" (Fox, 1982, p 207)

At the village level, the lambay ceremony was performed by the maglambay, who had the power to force villagers to participate in the ceremony, as well as enforcing laws against incest:

“Reflecting the twofold climatic needs of shifting-cultivation of dry rice and the unpredictability of the monthly rainfall in central Palawan ... the lambay ritual is held twice annually. The first lambay in January is an appeal in part for sunny days and dry winds which will dessicate the forests and faciliate the preparation of rice-clearings. The second one in May is for the moderate rains so necessary in the growth of the upland rice.  These two rituals are also petitions to the highest-ranking deity by the leader of the ceremony, the maglambay, that he forgive the people for acts of incest which they have committed ... The maglambay of Baraki is Nakib Dunglad. He succeeded his famous father, Dangus. Insofar as I know, all of the maglambay have been hereditary leaders for these are village rituals which demand the participation of every family. Dunglad exercises specified sanctions to enforce participation, a combined ritual and juridicial role. The fines for incest are paid to the maglambay. He is responsible to the highest ranking deity for these infamous acts, whether known to him or not, and he must defend his wards ... If the maglambay does not fulful the duties of his office properly, Magindusa might cause his death."" (Fox, 1982, p. 229)

There were two 'Pan-Tagbanuwa' ceremonies: pagbuy?is and runsay. The pagbuy?is was led by a figure called the mabuy?is:

""The Pagbuy?is. Abala, the mabuy?is in Baraki, performs this ritual three times a year ... [239] ... Abala succeeded his grandfather, Kamat, as a mabuy?is ... The salakap sail during the northeast winds in a huge boat, the sakayan, and bring smallpox, cholera, dysentery, flu and other epidemic sickness. They gather the souls of those who die and carry them back to kiyabusan, the 'end of the world' ... Abala calls these deities during the pagbuy?is to 'convince' them that they should not 'catch' the souls of the Tagbanuwa. The ritual offerings are said to placate them and to win their favour."" (Fox, 1982, pp. 238-239)

""A sizeable crowd was present, amazingly large in view of the fact that there would be no social drinking. The participants were mostly relatives of Abala and his wife and individuals whom they were both treating. However, this ritual is for all Tagbanuwa regardless of their kinship or residence. Abala considers himself a 'priest' and as responsible for protecting all the Tagbanuwa in Palawan against the salakap."" (Fox, 1982, p. 242)

The runsay was similar to the pagbuy?is. A footnote implies that the leader of this ceremony was also called magbuy?is:

""The Runsay. In many ways this is the most dramatic of the many Tagbanuwa rituals. It is held at night once a year - the fourth day after the full moon of December - on the beach near the mouth of the Arborlan River. The purpose of this ritual is identical to that of the pagbuy?is, that is, to protect all Tagbanuwa from the spirits of epidemic sicknesss.

""In 1950 the runsay fell on the twenty-fifth of December. The leader of the ceremony was Landag, a resident of Iraan. This was his twentieth performance."" (Fox, 1982, p. 242)

Footnote 51 to p. 242:

""According to Landag, the first leader or mabuy?is or [sic] runsay was Tagam. He was followed by Unas, Tanas, Lingdas, Ribras and Laksamana Dungul. Landag succeeded Dungul who was an older cousin of Landag's father.""",fox1982[145-247]
17698,bughotu,86,0,150-0,"""MODERN anthropological work in the Solomons, done in an age of peace and Christian missions, has emphasized the 'bourgeois' characteristics of big-man leadership. It is undoubtedly true that the accumulation and distribution of material wealth was crucial to the maintenance of big-man status in historical times- as the exploitation of trading contacts by Bera and others shows. However, in the head-hunting era in the western Solomons, status also depended a great deal upon success in warfare ... [67] ... The authority of these 19th century leaders was in many cases more absolute than that of the modern big-man. Although big-man leadership was usually limited to the village, with a large enough following a leader could command, through physical force, not only his own village but a district. Thus largely through the agency of head-hunting such men as Bera, Ingava and Gau extended their power. The expansion did not entail any form of institutionalized control, but lay simply in the realization of others, both villagers and lesser big-men, of their dominance”  (Jackson, 1975, pp 66-67)",jackson1975

19876,tanna,84,3,149-3,"‘Tanna: Stones within canoes’ (Bonnemaison, 1994, pp. 103-191)

Tanna was divided into many local groups called niko, 'canoes', that shared a 'dancing place' and appear to have constituted 'patrilocal clans'. These 'canoes' were often part of larger units that were also called 'canoes':

“For the most part, the population is scattered in small groups of houses along grassy trails in the bush or a wooded landscape dominated by coconut groves on the coast and tree ferns in the inland hills. Houses are also found near the dirt or coral roads that circle the island and cross it in one spot ... Near each small group of huts or houses is a dancing place, nakamal in Bislama or yimwayim in the language of Tanna's west coast ... Every day, men meet here at nightfall to drink kava together ... [108] The individuals who meet daily make up the core of a local group, a 'canoe' or niko as it is called on the island, which itself is often linked to a larger 'canoe' made up of several patrilocal clans sharing the same territory and mythical heritage.” (Bonnemaison, 1994, pp. 106-108)

Bonnemaison (1994, p. 140, Map 9: 'The Land Canoes: Traditional territories and groups in Tanna') provides a map of the 'canoes' into which Tanna is divided, and the 'dancing places' within them. I estimate that about 40 of them contained more than one dancing place (a more precise count is difficult because of the resolution of the map), and some of them contained more than 10. 

There were three 'explicitly defined social functions' in Tannese society, which appear to have operated at the 'canoe' level. One, naotupunus, involved 'agrarian magic' and is described as that of 'sanctioned mediator of supernatural forces'. These positions appear to have been assigned to clans rather than individuals: 

“In 1977 and 1978, when political issues and conflicts over land tenure (which I examine later) brought turmoil to the central part of Tanna, local customary groups endeavored to create a political system ... To my surprise, the pagans’ strategy was to look for the ‘aristocracy of the origins’ ... After recollecting the primordial sacred places through which humans, then food, had emerged on the island, the pagans designated the genuine keepers of such places as the big men of kastom. Real power accrued to them. The yani niko 'voices of the canoe' were granted political authority. Because they represent the ‘first men’ who have emerged from the stones, they are naturally in command of the political sphere as masters of Tanna's discourse ... The ‘voices of the canoe’ are also seen as the ‘surveyors’ of territory and the authorities on land sharing, internal boundaries, and external borders ... [131] ... After the yani niko come the naotupunus, in other words, the local clans associated with the networks of places whose magical powers stem from stones of agrarian fertility ... Life on Tanna rests on their magical activity. On the other hand, their connection with the sacred world of food excludes such clans from the political sphere. They have no ‘voice,’ only a type of power that is also a form of duty. Just as the yani niko clans represent the ‘voices of the canoe,’ the naotupunus clans are its ‘belly’. Thus Tanna’s first community seems to have evolved with a dual perspective: the forces of nature are split between masculine and feminine principles and, likewise, the original society itself is divided into male clans that rule the political sphere and female clans that rule the sphere of food-related magic.” (Bonnemaison, 1994, pp. 130-131)

“According to the island's oral traditions, Tannese society includes three explicitly defined social functions. These functions correspond to three groups of different status involved in separate types of activity; they can also be seen as three images of power. Keeping at the front of the canoe, the yremera is the canoe's ‘honor’ and living emblem. As such, his power—symbolized by the hawk—is linked with great ceremonial exchanges, the sharing of food, and the control of the traditional roads of alliance that allow for these activities. The yani niko or ‘voice of the canoe’ represents political will: keeping at the back of the canoe, he steers it in war times. He has authority over the territory, because he is heir to the ‘first man’ who appeared on it. Indeed, the yani niko keeps land for the others and is in charge of land sharing. His role is to highlight the yremera's glory and to speak on his behalf. Finally, the naotupunus works with agrarian magic: he holds the sacred powers immersed [151] in the canoe's places and is the sanctioned mediator of supernatural forces. As the canoe's belly, he keeps in the middle.” (Bonnemaison, 1994, pp. 150-151)

In a sense, the naotupunus were considered to be responsible for the fertility of the entire island:

“Since the naotupunus belong to the peaceful, fertile world of women, the moral code of war traditionally spared their lives. The Tannese say that the entire island ‘ate from their hands.’ Those hands could not be severed. Agrarian magicians would return to the foreground when ceremonial cycles ushered in an era of peace. At such time, true women were exchanged as brides and bountiful ritual foods were presented. Therefore peace among true men was possible thanks to the female universe.” (Bonnemaison, 1994, p. 171)

In the past the role of naotupunas was exercised by 'several men', presumably all belonging to the naotupunas clan:

“The magician's duty was gratifying in good years, thankless in bad years, and dangerous in the case of natural disaster. Today the magical function has been streamlined. Instead of several men as in the past, a single individual fulfills the task and abides by the related taboos. He is often assisted by his real or adopted son who is to replace him after learning about the process. While the magician always carries out his duties when a great ritual is being prepared, the timing is more flexible in normal years: generally the magician is only away for a few days to ‘wash’ his stones and plant yams in the sacred garden.” (Bonnemaison, 1994, p. 173)

Another magician who served the whole 'canoe' (and sometimes a pair of canoes') was the yatamassim or 'tabu man'. The relationship of this figure to the naotupunus is not clear:

“In nearly all cases, the territory of great canoes, or pairs of canoes, encompasses a sacred area (ika ussim) whose powers are multiple. Sacred areas may be used to put a spell on a distant enemy—or even an entire group in the case of war. To each sacred area is assigned a priest, tabu man in Bislama or yatamassim in Middle Bush language. The tabu man is in permanent contact with the magical world of yarimus spirits and is vested with the spirit of the ‘stone.’ … The tabu man acts only on the order of the ‘voices of the canoe,’ who reward him … A tabu man can see yarimus and participate in their lives, notably in their activities of warfare and lovemaking … For this reason, he is assigned the duty of feeding yarimus so they do not plunder gardens … The great sacred areas are frequently connected in pairs near traditional routes. They are also found in other territories, under different names. Sacred areas thus make up supraterritorial networks which cross Tanna along an east­west line, with a ‘heart’ generally located on the island's central road and ‘hands’ that spring out on both sides of the island.” (Bonnemaison, 1994, pp. 178-179)

Magicians could also serve groups other than their own:

“The various types of plants used in traditional horticulture hold their own magic. Besides yams, such plants include taro, bananas, kava, island cabbage, sugarcane, and the like. There are also magical processes for pig husbandry purposes—to cure a pig's illness, to have the animal grow well, and to have it return safely when it is lost. Other magical procedures involve hunting, fishing, fighting the rats that devastate gardens, in addition to war, love, and so forth. The list is nearly endless; each group has its own techniques, stones, and traditions. Further, magical practices are like goods that may be borrowed or exchanged between villages. Not only does the magician work for his group, he is able to serve an entire network of alliance in this respect.” (Bonnemaison, 1994, p. 173)",bonnemaison1994[103-191]

'Magic and religion' (Chinnery, 1928, pp. 157-162)

Two kinds of religious specialists are mentioned in the sources - various kinds of magician (described both by Chinnery and Nevermann) and spirit mediums (described only by Chinnery). Neither appear to have occupied any formal 'office'.

'Sun sorcerers' (aitako - 'sun magicians' would seem to be a more accurate translation) are the only religious specialists that Nevermann describes in detail. According to Nevermann there was usually only one aitako in each district, but not necessarily. Also, there were conflicting reports about the identity of the sun sorcerer(s) in one district. The power of the aitako appears to have been person rather than institutional - the 'sun stones' through which they controlled the weather ceased to be effective upon his death.

“Magic with sun stones (atu sinak) is practiced to induce the sun to cause the taro to thrive in their own gardens, or to make them shrivel in the heat in their enemies’ fields … Normally in each district there is only one sun sorcerer, aitako … who is at the same time the ‘preparer’ of the stone. The effectiveness of the stone ceases on his death. In Etalat the chief Ainemoria is regarded as the sun sorcerer, while in Enai it is Kirie, at in Elemakunaur Kealo. From other reports, three men, Rod, Tukurui, and Namaran, were skilled in sun-and rain magic in Elemakunaur. Wura kept one of the the Enai stones, the chief Labokorori the other. Eura’s house was on the beach facing the sunrise; when rain persisted for too long, Kirie buried Wura’s stone on the beach at sunrise, causing the sun to rise. Kirie carried Labokori’s stone to the spot where the sun was needed, for example in the taro fields, and buried it. The stone remained there until people no longer wanted the sun but needed rain instead. A rain charm often had to made [sic], for this to happen … If the Enai people wanted to cause harm to their enemies, Kirie took Labokorori’s stone into their territory secretly at night, and buried it on the path from Enai.” (Nevermann, 2010, p. 176)

Chinnery has this to say about the 'inheritance of magical knowledge':

""Magical knowledge is said to be handed down through the aloa [sister's son - p. 129] or failing a relative of this status, through the nearest a mali [clan - p. 114] connection. It may also be acquired through gift or by purchase from a practitioner with whom one is on terms of friendship."" (Chinnery, 1959, p. 159)

Spirit mediums are described as follows:

""In the olden days there were certain women who had the power to communicate with raroai and to acquire from their ghostly advisers useful information regarding the life and interests of the people ... [158] ...  Persons requiring advice were admitted into the hut, their questions were communicated to the raroai, and its whistling replies were interpreted by the operator ... The art was handed down from mother to daughter. I met one woman who had received part of the instruction, her mother having died before all the secrets were revealed. She gave me no details, but in a general way suggested that the preparation extended over a long period. It was marked by periods of fasting and forms of self-sacrifice. It included a knowledge of certain magical plants and a number of incantations, the words and sequence of which she has now forgotten."" (Chinnery, 1928, pp. 157-158)

Unlike in many Pacific Island societies, 'chiefs' do not appear to have played a 'priestly' role. They could be magicians (see Nevermann, 2010, p. 176 above) but there is no indication that this was one of the functions attached to their office. Their functions are described as follows:

“Every small village on St Matthias and Emir had its own chief, (bau), whose orders are carried out, generally without question. The least significant of these chiefs, furthermore, are [158] nothing more than a form of ‘oldest person’ on a farm, and there are even individual houses with their own bau … Bigger villages often have two chiefs side by side. This was the case in 1908 in Elukabiu, part of the village of Elemakunaur, where Makarinitan (Sagile), and Tuputeput were both chiefs. Makarinitan appeared to have the seniority. Any visits were made to him first. 

“The functions of these greater chiefs consist of dealing with other villages through their chiefs, leading the men in warfare, adjudicating between quarrelling subjects, receiving visitors to the village (to whom the bau first offers a chew of betel in the chief’s house), and arranging feasts."" (Nevermann, 2010, p. 158)

'Feasting' had a religious component, but appears to have occurred for largely secular reasons:

""Occasions for feasts are: conclusion of an alliance between two villages, visits from neighbours, settlement of major debts, preparation for war, and similar events. Not uncommonly, [178] feasts also seem to be improved, with greater emphasis on dancing than on the festive meal. That religious moments also play a major role in feasts is demonstrated by dance sticks with images of the dead, and probably also by the bird-shaped dance accessories, (sinaku).""

20152,main-reef-islands,86,1,150-1,"The only group larger than a household that appears to have had any kind of official leadership was the 'joint household'. This was usually a group of households whose heads were a set of brothers or a father and his sons. The joint household cooperated in a range of economic endeavours and was under the authority of the eldest household head:

“Between the settlement unit and the constituent household is a discernable grouping of special note. This is the joint household that is held together by bonds of close kinship and made up of several closely related households, usually living in the same settlement. This is the social unit within which garden labor is regularly exchanged when new gardens are being cleared and seeded. It is a grouping that often shares food, eats from a common oven, and cooperates in many ways when a large labor force is needed. It is also a group that is apt to form a bloc under its senior household head in the men's house association.

“The joint household group consists of two or more households linked by close agnatic ties among their male heads. That is to say, it is brought together under the recognized kinship authority of a senior living man such as an elder brother and his younger brothers, a father and his sons, or both of these lateral and lineal ties combined.

“At times when even greater resources are demanded, such as preparing for feasts, this joint household grouping is expanded to include married daughters and sisters, their husbands and entire households. Were this society characterized by some kind of patrilineal descent categories, this mobilization of household resources by siblingships and agnatic filial links would merely represent the minimal span of the lineage principal. Descent, on the contrary, is reckoned matrilineally. Therefore, the joint households is formed by principles of [173] filiation alone and is to be considered a manifestation of the kinship system, not descent.

""Furthermore, when a senior agnate dies, the joint household does not cohere in his name or by virtue of the fact that the constituent households are related through a common and remembered male agnate. If, for example, one brother of a siblingship lives, he has authority over all the households of his younger brothers and those descended from them, whether his siblings are alive or not. When he dies, as the last of his siblingship, the descended household heads of his siblingship do not regroup in the same ways. Each then coheres around its senior male sibling who has authority over other household heads descended from that siblingship. It is this mode of passing on authority, without reference to common descent beyond the living, that prevents, so to speak, patrilineal lineages from forming.” (Davenport, 1969, pp. 172-173)

The 'men's house association', described as the 'main political organisation' in this society, was larger than the joint household, but unlike the joint household leadership of this association was achievement-based, informal, and non-authoritarian:

“The men's house association and the structure itself (sepolaū) have already been mentioned in a number of varied contexts. As indicated, the association is the main political organization of this society. Its members are adult men, but [214] its constituencies are households, single and joint. Influence within the association is the same as general social rank which is derived in the first place by wealth spent on several kinds of rites and observances. The leadership of an association was, and is, anything but authoritarian. Usually, one man is recognized as senior in it, and the house is spoken of as belonging to him. But all men of influence have a say in its deliberations and decisions. There are no formal offices or positions as was the case on Utupua and Vanikoro ... Formerly, one of the major concerns of the men's house association was stimulating and maintaining trade and the specialized crafts upon which trade depended. Most men's house had trading alliances with other distant houses in the Reef Islands and on other islands of the Santa Cruz Group. This meant that when either partner in the alliance made a trading expedition it went first to its partner's house to obtain hospitality and to give the first opportunity to buy.” (Davenport, 1969, pp. 213-214)

“As always, any man is free to organize a men's house association. All he needs is a following. The following can be as minimal as the men drawn, by kinship ties, from his own joint household. It can be as maximal as to embrace the men of several residential wards or an entire village. To have a small association means it has few resources to manipulate, and there is no way in which a large and important group can be assembled by purely coercive or ascriptive means. Every association of importance is a group that coheres around its senior man or men by virtue of their achieved power and influence. This is the essence of the open and volatile political system of Melanesia that is often called the ‘Big Man System’.

“This system is a political structure without government; an organization that exists only as long as its leadership effectively deals with recognized problems and activities about which there is public concern. Its growth and decline, continuity and succession depend upon two things: highly regarded resources and social activities by means of which men can aspire to win differential positions of social influence and dignity and the requisite distribution of personalities that provides persons who will actively compete for prestige.” (Davenport, 1969, p. 220)",davenport1969

20231,main-reef-islands,84,1,149-1,"Religion (Davenport, 1969, pp. 220-239)

The religion of the Main Reef Islands centred around 'tutelary spirits' called ne. Each 'senior man' (the head of a household or 'joint household') had one or more tutelaries:

“The second set of supernaturals are those who are the tutelary deities to whom prayers and other rituals were directed. In pagan times each senior man had one or more tutelaries on whose powers he relied for continued help and special assistance in difficult situations. By senior man is meant a man with domestic responsibilities for his own household at least or for a larger joint household if he was the individual round whom one of these extended families cohered."" (Davenport, 1969, p. 225)

A senior man could be considered to have had 'religious authority' over his household or joint household, since his tutelary was presumably to some extent also seen as the tutelary of the group that he headed. The senior man had few exclusive 'rights' to his tutelary deity, since 'one could ask any deity for anything without consulting any of its worshippers', but does appear to have had the right to 'attend' to its image in public ceremonies:

“As is clear from all that has been said, women had nothing to do with the worship of tutelary deities. A man usually continued to venerate the deity of the household in which he was reared, that is, he followed his father. Occasionally, he continued after a mother's brother. It made no difference. As mentioned, most worship was private and undertaken in the dwelling where a man could recognize any deity he wished. Publicly, however, the senior man of the group who venerated the same deity took primary responsibility for the representation that was kept in the cult house and for attending this image in public recognitions. But, as also indicated, men often switched from one deity to another, and one could ask any deity for anything without consulting any of its worshippers. [237] Thus, the relationship between supernatural tutelary and his human client was a loose one that was as much subject to choice as to ascription or inheritance.” (Davenport, 1969, pp. 236-237)

Although most worship was private, 'public rituals' also occurred on an ad-hoc basis at the instigation of 'influential men'. These rituals could involve an entire ward or village, and were believed to benefit the whole group:

“In any ward or village the collection of tutelary deities worshipped constituted a supernatural population of that residential grouping. In every respect the tutelaries were regarded as residents, albeit special residents, of the community and whose presence was acknowledge continually. The cult house (opone) was the structure where the material representations or images (also called ne) were housed and in or around which some of the rituals took place. Care of the cult house was a joint responsibility of all whose images were kept inside. One of the periodic rituals was the refurbishing of this house or the building of a new one. When this was done, the work feast became a ritual feast to which all the resident tutelaries were the honored guests.

“So many of these personal tutelaries were worshipped throughout the islands that no one person could know the names of them all. Several individuals in different villages could worship the same deity, so there was some overlap between communities, but the assemblage of deities in every community was unique. Because each deity was also a unique personality with general and special [226] powers that could be ellicited by a successful appeal, the inventory of ritual observances of each community was as distinctive as its cluster of deities.” (Davenport, 1969, pp. 225-226)

""As with maturation feasts, it often occurred that more than one worshipper held his public feast to his deity at the same time. Multiple celebrations meant more food, larger distributions, and more visitors — a bigger social event. It was part of the role of the influential men of each community to organize such multiple celebrations so that the entire community would benefit both from the supernatural favors of the deities and the social prestige gained from giving a large feast for the enjoyment of all who came. One such occasion might be when it was clear that the cult house had to be rebuilt or refurbished. More often it was an occasion when the entire community was suffering from some catastrophy such as an epidemic or failure of crops. These celebrations in which every image was honored were not calendric and not observed until some situation demanded it. At this time every man with an image in the house contributed [228] to the celebration."" (Davenport, 1959, pp. 227-228)

One type of religious specialist is mentioned, the spirit medium (toūlatū). Little is said about these figures, but they appear to have served individual clients:

“While most communication from worshipper to deity was either by ordinary conversation (through the medium of some kind of material representation), offering presents of food, or by celebrating feasts to which the deity was an honored guest, there were also spirit mediums (toūlatū) whose special talents were needed in situations that required a different approach. Both men and women were mediums, and becoming one depended entirely upon personal calling. The services of a medium were used, hired that is, whenever a worshipper was in a quandry about something supernatural. It was the task of the medium to penetrate the boundary between the natural and supernatural dimensions of the universe and obtain the information sought. Unfortunately, the writer did not obtain good data on mediums and their work.” (Davenport, 1969, p. 237)",davenport1969

20241,main-reef-islands,85,1,151-1,"The only group larger than a household that appears to have had any kind of official leadership was the 'joint household'. This was usually a group of households whose heads were a set of brothers or a father and his sons. The joint household cooperated in a range of economic endeavours and was under the authority of the eldest household head:

“Between the settlement unit and the constituent household is a discernable grouping of special note. This is the joint household that is held together by bonds of close kinship and made up of several closely related households, usually living in the same settlement. This is the social unit within which garden labor is regularly exchanged when new gardens are being cleared and seeded. It is a grouping that often shares food, eats from a common oven, and cooperates in many ways when a large labor force is needed. It is also a group that is apt to form a bloc under its senior household head in the men's house association.

“The joint household group consists of two or more households linked by close agnatic ties among their male heads. That is to say, it is brought together under the recognized kinship authority of a senior living man such as an elder brother and his younger brothers, a father and his sons, or both of these lateral and lineal ties combined.

“At times when even greater resources are demanded, such as preparing for feasts, this joint household grouping is expanded to include married daughters and sisters, their husbands and entire households. Were this society characterized by some kind of patrilineal descent categories, this mobilization of household resources by siblingships and agnatic filial links would merely represent the minimal span of the lineage principal. Descent, on the contrary, is reckoned matrilineally. Therefore, the joint households is formed by principles of [173] filiation alone and is to be considered a manifestation of the kinship system, not descent.

""Furthermore, when a senior agnate dies, the joint household does not cohere in his name or by virtue of the fact that the constituent households are related through a common and remembered male agnate. If, for example, one brother of a siblingship lives, he has authority over all the households of his younger brothers and those descended from them, whether his siblings are alive or not. When he dies, as the last of his siblingship, the descended household heads of his siblingship do not regroup in the same ways. Each then coheres around its senior male sibling who has authority over other household heads descended from that siblingship. It is this mode of passing on authority, without reference to common descent beyond the living, that prevents, so to speak, patrilineal lineages from forming.” (Davenport, 1969, pp. 172-173)

Religion (Davenport, 1969, pp. 220-239): The 'senior men' who headed households or joint households also appear to have been the only figures that wielded any kind of religious authority. Each 'senior man' had one or more tutelaries, who appear to have been in some sense also the tutelaries of the group that he headed. While the senior man had few exclusive rights to his tutelary deity (since 'one could ask any deity for anything without consulting any of its worshippers', he does appear to have had the right to 'attend' to its image in public ceremonies:

“The second set of supernaturals are those who are the tutelary deities to whom prayers and other rituals were directed. In pagan times each senior man had one or more tutelaries on whose powers he relied for continued help and special assistance in difficult situations. By senior man is meant a man with domestic responsibilities for his own household at least or for a larger joint household if he was the individual round whom one of these extended families cohered."" (Davenport, 1969, p. 225)

A man usually continued to venerate the deity of the household in which he was reared, that is, he followed his father. Occasionally, he continued after a mother's brother. It made no difference.

Publicly, however, the senior man of the group who venerated the same deity took primary responsibility for the representation that was kept in the cult house and for attending this image in public recognitions. But, as also indicated, men often switched from one deity to another, and one could ask any deity for anything without consulting any of its worshippers. [237] Thus, the relationship between supernatural tutelary and his human client was a loose one that was as much subject to choice as to ascription or inheritance.” (Davenport, 1969, pp. 236-237)",davenport1969

'Religion' (Ferdon, 1987, pp. 69-95)

""William Mariner’s summary, as published by Dr John Martin, seems to indicate that there were at least four basic classes of people. There was the ‘eiki, or chiefly, class, followed by individuals known as matapule, others known as mu’a, and at the bottom of the scale a group called tu’a ... [26] ... Until Mariner recorded his knowledge of Tongan culture, there was no information on the subject of what factors allowed an individual the right to be included in the ranks of the chiefly class. According to Mariner’s understanding, this governing class was made up of individuals related in varying degrees to either the presumed god personified having the title of Tu’i Tonga, another individual also of presumed divine origin named Veasi ... or what was then termed the Hau, or supreme secular chief. The last-named was a relatively new position of authority that, as will later be explained, may have come into being during the last quarter of the eighteenth century.” (Ferdon, 1987, pp 25-26)

“Whatever the actual history of the Tu’i Tonga, by 1777 the authoritative aspects of his exalted position was definitely on the decline. Cook made this clear when he wrote that the ‘King’ frequently complained to him that Maealiuaki and ‘old Toobough’ (Tupou), whom Cook claimed were the two most powerful chiefs on Tongatapu, frequently thwarted measures promulgated by him. That his authority even then may have been largely limited to the central district of mu’a, where he resided, was suggested when he explained to James King that he could not be responsible for the conduct of a number of thieves in the neighbourhood who had been pestering Europeans. In 1797 he explained to Wilson that although he did not approve of certain actions of natives within his locale, he could not punish them for they did noit belong to that part of the island over which he governed. By then the Tu’i Kanokupolu controlled the soil-rich district of hihifo, the Tu’i Tonga the central district of mu’a, and a chief by the name of Vaharlo the eastern hahake districts.” (Ferdon, 1987, p. 31)

“As noted above, there was not a great deal of information about the titled position of Tu’i Tonga. Most of what little there was came from Vason and Mariner. The Tu’i Tonga claimed to be revered throughout the islands, and in Vason’s time was said to be supported in splendour and dignity not only through contributions from the various districts, but from the products of his own large land-holdings … However, by 1806 or so, his power had diminished to such an extent that in spite of his rank, the only direct authority he commanded was said by Mariner to be limited to his own family and attendants. Nonetheless, his high rank and religious status, at least until the death of Tu’i Tonga Fuanunuiava, dictated certain procedures and restraints.” (Ferdon, 1987, p. 33)","ferdon1987[25-50, 69-95]"

“In order to understand anything connected with ritual it is important to recognize the autonomy of the Nuaulu patrilineal clan and variations between clans in terms of demography, history and cultural practice. Indeed, in many ways, Nuaulu identity as a whole might most accurately be expressed as ‘a consensual federation of originally separate and autonomous groups’ (Valeri 2001 [1990a]:293). Throughout the period of my fieldwork there have been 12 Nuaulu clans (ipane or ipan; ‘soa’ in Ambonese Malay), all resident in the South Seram Area. At the time of my fieldwork in 1970-71, these were distributed between five main physical settlements …” (Ellen, 2014, p. 19)

“I shall have much to say regarding variation between clans in subsequent chapters, as we consider different categories of ritual … The reasons underlying different interpretation are various, from trivial cultural ‘drift’ to the ever-present tension between those Nuaulu who seek a unified settlement – perhaps even a raja of their own – and those who do not. However, the default position is the considerable autonomy that individual clans have, not only in matters regarding ritual (though particularly in regard to such matters), but in regard to other forms of social action and cultural practice as well … Each Nuaulu clan is a diarchy, ideally divided into two equal, reciprocally exchanging sections or ‘houses’, and Nuaulu religion can be summarily characterized as ancestor-worship focused on clan houses (numa). These latter are moiety-like groups based on descent and affiliation to either the numa onate (large or main house) or the numa kapitane (house of the war leader. The two houses are, therefore, simultaneously [23] complementary and hierarchic. The numa onate, alternatively called the numa maiane … takes precedence in ritual matters and is therefore senior, but only as a kind of primus inter pares … By contrast, numa kapitane is associated with the brothers of the wife and the brothers of the mother, who are outsiders to all ritual held in the numa maiane. The distinction between houses corresponds to an important distinction in Nuaulu kinship, namely that between the children of the brother and children of the sister.” (Ellen, 2014, pp. 21-22)

""Not only are there differences between clans in matters relating to physical orientation, but also between groups of clans in particular settlements, and between settlements. During the long period between approximately 1880 and 1980, when most Nuaulu clans were located around Sepa, the higher, mountainward settlement of Ahusuru embodied values of ancestrality and monne, while the lower, seaward settlement of Watane embodied the specific values of ancestrality associated with each kin group. This relationship was reflected in the roles of the ia onate Matoke-hanaie (the 'male' Matoke clan chief, primus inter pares of all clan ritual chiefs, located in Ahisuru), and the ia onate aia (the head of all [44] Nuaulu in matters relating to political interaction with the outside world, located in Watane)."" (Ellen, 2014, pp.  42-44)

""All clan heads carry onerous duties as ritual specialists, but - at least formally - the greatest burden falls on the shoulders of the chief of the Matoke clan, who has a role comparable to that described widely in Ambonese Malay as 'tuan tahah'. Matoke takes precedence on earth, the chief of Matoke-hanaie in Aihisuru and the chief of Matoke-pina in Rouhua ... In addition, there are other quite specific ritual specialists, such as the maritihanna ... In Rouhua a title given by the chief of Matoke to a sacred house of the clan Sonaue with responsibility for organizing the suane ritual and leading the kahuae, re-bestowed on the death of each incumbent. Somewhat differently, those who perform as spirit mediums, though typically heads of houses or their wives, must also be qualified by virtue of their ability to enter into a trance and call down ancestral spirits, a skill that does not come to all of those in the preferred structural position, and is sometimes executed best by those who have acquired the role by dint of achievement.""

17723,dobuans,86,0,150-0,"According to both Bromilow and Fortune, Dobuans lived in very small 'villages' that nevertheless seem to have formed independent local communities (outsiders could not enter without permission):

“Their villages (or hamlets, for they are very small) lie closely packed upon the fertile foreshores, but hidden from each other by the thick growth of coconut palms, bananas, yams, and other vegetation. The public tracks or roads do not pass through villages, but skirt their edges; and a stranger or visitor has now (or used not to have) the right of entry to a village, but must wait to be called and admitted.” (Bromilow, 1929, p. 78) 

“The idea village of Dobu is a circle of huts facing inward to a central, often elevated mound, which is the village graveyard … A path … goes around the village behind the backs of the houses. This is for the use of passers by, who are not allowed to enter the village unless they are closely related to its members, or unless they have legitimate business of moment to transact.” (Fortune, 1932, p. 1)

“The first reliable records of Dobuan population show that there was an average of twenty-five persons, men, woman, and children, in each village."" (Fortune, 1932, p. 30)

According to Bromilow, Dobu Island was divided into eleven 'tribes', at least some of which consisted of multiple villages and had 'headmen' (Bromilow was himself appointed to this role).

“I have spoken of the Dobuan law that no outsider should be allowed a permanent footing on the island, unless by the goodwill of a tribe he were admitted a member of it by adoption  ... It was a satisfaction to us when an early adoption was voted us by the ‘Edugaula tribe. There were eleven tribes on the island, but the ‘Edugaula, living on the north-west side, was the most numerous sna dmost war-like, and the mission house was within it’s area. It was almost always at enmity with other tribes, but had made a temporary local peace just before our arrival, in order to join in a war against a distant and common enemy ... [126] ... In this tribe descent was through the mother, to whose family the children belong ... Into this remarkable tribe my wife and I and our daughter were adopted.

“The headmen came to us and asked us to go with them to certain villages, but gave no reason for this ... We went first to a village, Nemunemu, close at hand. The proceedings were very simple; taking us to the centre of the village, and pointing to a coconut-tree surrounded by a small area of land, the spokesman said, ‘That is yours. You are our father.’ ... We were then taken to another village, and there my [127] wife received her tree, and was designated ‘Mother.’ At a third village there was a repetition, and our daughter was proclaimed ‘Sister.’ ... As each tree given to use was rooted in the soil of Dobu, so we were now on the footing of those born in the land, with an inheritance in it. We three were Dobuans, of the fearsome ‘Edugaula tribe ... Some time after this I was advanced to further tribal honour. I became on very friendly terms with the headman of a certain tribe, and we exchanged frequent visits. He would call me by his own name, Meiakway (Black Tongue), as a mark of his esteem, an action carrying high significance to his people. When, later, Meiakwau died, representatives of the tribe came to me requesting me to take over the headship of the tribe. This I declined; but they were importunate. They were so much in earnest that I agreed to accept if the office could be made an honourary one. They consented to relieve me of all local and corporate duties and responsibilities; and on this condition I became titular headman, receiving as my insignia of office a greenstone axe, a magnificent specimen, the blade being of great size, set in a carved handle. I still possess this emblem of the greatness that was thrust upon me."" (Bromilow, 1929, pp. 125-127)

Fortune describes the grouping of villages into 'localities', which are clearly the same as Bromilow's 'tribes'.

""A group of neighbouring villages forms a local unit with a local name. This local unit I propose to call the locality. The locality numbers from four to twenty villages. It is on terms of permanent hostility with other localities.” (Fortune, 1932, p. 30)

In contrast to Bromilow, Fortune denies that formal leadership existed at the locality level, or indeed at any level. Rather, there were simply influential men:

“There is only the most embryonic germ of government by chieftainship. In each locality there are one or two persons of outstanding influence. Such leadership occurs when a man [84] of unusual character happens to be born into a rich inheritance of magical ritual power. Such a man was Alo of my own village of the Green Parrot folk ... Other villages of Alo’s locality were not so ruled, however. There was no other outstanding man. All old men get more respect than young men from their juniors. But the decisions of three or four elder men are more conflicting, less decisively clear, and useless in the case of a dispute between village owners ... [85] ... In case of quarrel within the circle of village owners, such ill-led villages resolve into opposing parties. This actually happens in the majority of villages, but not so anarchically in a village that has an outstanding man of Alo’s quality ... Alo’s influence extended over his whole locality of several villages for fixing the sailing dates for overseas expeditions when the whole locality acted at one time. He had the best inheritance of the magical ritual necessary for overseas sailing. Such influence over several villages is a pure function of magical specialization however. In the same locality an old woman of another village than mine came to the fore as the one rain-maker in the locality. Her importance increased in time of drought, just as Alo’s did in time of large overseas expeditions.” (Fortune, 1932, pp. 83-85)

Possibly the discrepancy between the two accounts is a matter of terminology and emphasis. The 'headmen' that Bromilow described could have been simply 'men of outstanding influence', though the fact that the role had 'insignia of office' suggests something more formal. Bromilow does note elsewhere that leadership in New Guinea (presumably including Dobu) was achieved rather than inherited:

""The village constable has local authority as a representative of the Government, and takes the place of the hereditary tribal chief, who practically does not exist in Papua, except in the Trobriands. A chief obtains his position by force of character and capacity for leadership, which often mean rivalry and strife before the point is settled.” (Bromilow, 1929, p. 272)

In addition to 'headmen', Bromilow also describes the role of 'standard bearer' (tonidoe). This was clearly quite a formal office, but it is not clear that outlasted any one raiding expedition:

“The most important person in all Dobuan raiding expeditions was the tonidoe (standard-bearer). At the time of our arrival Gaganumore held this position, to the increased honour of Dobu. Before setting out, he and his immediate personal following would prepare a feast for all who were to join in the affray. This was followed by a harangue to the warriors, who in turn performed the prescribed incantations over their spears, slings, and clubs, and applied to their bodies charms that were to make them invulnerable, and while doing so encouraged each other with boastful talk. At the appointed time the standard-bearer launched his canoe, holding up a spear with a flag of pandanus-leaf tied to the top of it; the others of the expedition paddled their canoes into line, then stood up and, with shouts and yells, exhorted the standard-bearer to lead them proudly and fiercely to victory. [119] A general hurling and dodging of spears took place, and when sufficient fighting spirit had been stirred the tonidoe led the fleet to sea and the spot selected for their first raid. They were often absent for days on these expeditions; villages were attacked and looted in the early mornings, and more pitched fights took place wherever the enemy might be met.” (Bromilow, 1929, pp. 118-119)

Consequently, most social relations take place within the community."" (Rousseau, 1974, p 182)

""The chief plays a central role in the political life; for communal matters, he is the single most important decision maker. He is the ultimate judicial authority and solves disputes by way of adjudication, not mediation; he may initiate judicial proceedings against anyone within the community. He sets the dates of the public ceremonies and of the firing of the fields. He has the final say on such matters as the rebuilding and resettlement of the longhouse. He also keeps an almost absolute control over intercommunity matters. Because of his position, he can demand various prestations of work and goods from the members of his community.

""The office of chief is occupied by a single individual, but the Kayan consider that authority is vested in the whole maren group, and not only in one person; there is no single word in Kayan for 'chief' the nearest expression ‘iha alang gri daha', ‘he who leads them.""

18134,tikopia,86,3,150-3,"'The Tikopia political system in 1929' (Firth, 1959, pp. 255-260)

""The Tikopia system of government in 1929, as apparently for many generations before, may be briefly described as a loosely structured oligarchy. This [256] ‘government by the few’ in Tikopia had as its core the institution of chieftainship ...There were four chiefs, each termed te Ariki, and each bearing in his title the name of the clan over which he had jurisdiction and which he represented in all major public affairs ... But how far was the government of Tikopia literally oligarchical, a ‘rule by the few’? Each chief was autonomous as regards authority over his own clan. But there was no unified, central authority. The Ariki Kafika, who had first precedence in the major religious rites, was in political affairs only primus inter pares … As far as definition goes, the Term ‘oligarchy’ could clearly be properly applied to a set of chiefs who met together in council, discussed questions of [257] public import and came to some agreed conclusions as to policy and action to be taken. There was no such formal mechanism, with regular meetings and procedure, in Tikopia. But the chiefs as a whole were ultimately held responsible for policy by the people. They strove for a common front on matters of general relevance and were keenly interested in the implementation of policy. Since, although they were autonomous, much of their policy was collective and forged in relation to one another's views, their government may be said to constitute an oligarchical rule. But because formal arrangements to this end were embryonic and irregular, one may speak of the oligarchy as loosely structured.

“Yet authority and government in Tikopia were not simply dispersed among unrelated leaders. Although not unified, as the governmental system became in some of the larger Polynesian communities during the nineteenth century, the government of Tikopia may be termed centralized and conjoint. A chief could operate independently and often did so, but the more his operations affected matters of import to the whole community, the more his fellow-chiefs tended to become involved until they found it necessary to take action of some kind themselves. There were various mechanisms whereby one chief could ascertain the views of another and secure his acquiescence, and ultimately some collective activity could be promoted … It was thus not difficult for chiefs to decide upon a common course of action if this were required. Moreover, apart from any overt exchanges of opinion, there was among the chiefs a tacit implied consensus on many matters of public policy, as could be expected from the general nature of their common economic and religious interests … [258] … The powers exercised by a Tikopia chief were very wide. They included ultimate control of the lands of his clan--a right with practical effect particularly for the lands of those lineages ultimately sprung from chiefly stock. The chiefs' powers included also rights to certain first fruits … His powers were such that he might order off to sea as the extreme of banishment a man who offended him personally or broke a grave rule of conduct.

“Government of Tikopia through the coajoint powers of the chiefs raises the question of the jurisdiction which each of them exercised. The basis of the Tikopia political system lay in the chief as head and representative of his clan. Every person in Tikopia as a member of a clan acknowledged obedience to his own chief. But the jurisdiction of each chief was not simply restricted to a clan alignment. It also operated on a local bosis, although this was less clearly defined. Each chief lived in a separate village and in that village exercised great authority. Moreover, his authority also extended throughout the whole district--or side of the island--in which he regularly lived. For social purposes the jurisdiction of the chiefs was closely related to this district division. In particular, the single authority of the Ariki Tafua in the district of Faea contrasted with the treble authority of the other chiefs who together held sway over the district of Ravenga and its subsidiary Namo. These political relations of the chiefs were very important in general district rivalry and intra-district co-operation.

“But the jurisdiction of a Tikopia chief was not only in district terms any more than in purely clan terms. Every person in Tikopia acknowledged obedience to any chief in a situation with which both were immediately concerned. A chief could claim by general status much of which he was debarred from claiming by the lack of clan right. In other words, there was a notion of a general order in Tikopia in which a chief, by virtue of his office, had jurisdiction in respect of the whole society.” (Firth, 1959, pp 255-258)",firth1959A[255-260]

19329,tikopia,85,2,151-2,"‘Pagan religious leaders’ (Firth, 1970, pp. 31-63)

Religious authority in Tikopia was in the hands of 'priests'. 'Spirit mediums also existed, but Firth is emphatic that they did not occupy an office:

“In many societies two commonly recognized types of religious representatives are priests and prophets. These are terms of conventional usage, but as sociologists, in particular Max Weber, have indicated, their characteristics are largely in contrast. A priest is essentially the holder of a ritual office, and his authority rests upon that office. A prophet is essentially the holder of a personal position; he is an interpreter of the [32] divine will, a man who holds his authority through a special personal revelation ... I have set out this analysis to help to elucidate upon the position of Tikopia religious leaders. Tikopia ritual officiants, whether chiefs or [Page 33] elders, may be termed priests in so far as they were the persons primarily responsible for the conduct of ritual, the major performers and the ministers in the sacred places ... Tikopia paganism had priests but no prophets, ritual leaders but not religious men with revealed knowledge of the divine. But though prophets were absent the contrast between man in ritual office and man in special relation to the divine was present in another way--between priest and spirit medium. A spirit medium--in the most general mode of belief--is an inspired person, through whose personal exposition of divine or spirit activity, particularly in speech, his success is achieved.” (Firth, 1970, pp. 31-33)

'Priests' (who lacked an indigenous name), were divided into 'chiefs' and 'elders', with the former having authority over the latter. Chiefs held formal political power, whereas elders did not:

“Traditional Tikopia priests, discussed mainly so far as a single category, were in fact of two distinct types, chiefs and elders. Each priest, socially [37] defined, was the head of a major lineage, his succession set within a hereditary system. As such he had responsibility for lineage lands and for good order of lineage affairs. Each priest, religiously defined, was responsible for a set of ritual tasks which kept the members of his lineage in proper relation with the spirit world, and was the possessor of sets of ritual names and formulae which were part of his equipment to that end. Each priest was regarded as controlling gods and ancestral spirits for the good of the whole group he represented, and not for his own personal advancement or protection. A criterion of moral responsibility thus attached to the exercise of his functions. Again, each priest occupied his religious office in his own person alone. Though a deputy might at his behest perform some of the subsidiary rites, no one but he could perform the major rites associated with his office. If a priest were ill, as happened on occasion during my stay in Tikopia, the most important rites at which he alone could officiate were simply omitted ... But the categories of chief and elder were sharply differentiated in several ways. They were named differently: a chief, te ariki , and an elder, te pure (matapure, pure matua) . There was no general, common word for priest.

“In the religious sphere they were differentiated primarily by the relative magnitude of their ritual functions, and by the supremacy of the role of the chiefs. There was differentiation of type and range of spirits which each was supposed to control, but this was a matter of degree rather than of kind, and there was much overlapping. But ritually each chief was the priest for his clan, and as such was the apex of the structure of clan elders; whereas each elder was priest only for his lineage and had no inferior priests under him. In accession to office the elder became a priest by act of ordination. His title and sacerdotal powers were conferred upon him by his clan chief, with unction, the tying of a sacred gorget round his neck, and the pronouncement of a formula for welfare. A chief, surprisingly, became a priest without such ordination; on being elected to his political office by public acclaim he soon afterwards inducted himself into his religious office by the first performance of a rite … A chief then was elected, an elder nominated … In public affairs generally a chief occupied a specific political office, whereas an elder did not, and had no specific political responsibilities. In this a ritual elder ( pure ) was sharply marked off from an executive ( maru ); elders had religious duties but no political status as such; maru had political duties, but no religious status at all. A chief had both. An elder might have political influence, but his lack of political recognition as an office holder makes the term ‘ritual elder’ appropriate. Looked at from another point of view, the significant difference between chief and elder, ritually and politically, was that an elder could never be promoted to be a chief--his traditional origin and entitlement were of an entirely separate order from those of a chief.” (Firth, 1970, pp. 36-38)

""In traditional conditions, the Tikopia ariki was the most senior person in his lineage, by election with prime reference to genealogical criteria. He was also the leader of the clan which bore his lineage name. Hence in general conversation he was often referred to by clan members and others as tatou mana , our father. Defined in economic terms a chief was the administrative head of the lands of the chiefly lineage and titular controller of the lands of his clansfolk. He was not necessarily the most wealthy in lands and food, but he had the power to mobilize clan resources for large-scale disbursement of food, and he was the nominal referent for special types of resources known as the ‘valuables of chiefs’ and the ‘food of chiefs’ … Politically defined, a chief was the prime leader in the area where he lived, and final authority for his clan in disputes; with his peers he constituted the final court of appeal on matters of public policy."" (Firth, 1970, p. 40)

Political and religious authority were not entirely conjoined, however. Whereas politically all chiefs had equal status, in island-wide religious ceremonies one (the Ariki Kafika) was clearly pre-eminent:

“Structurally in social and political terms the Tikopia chiefs were autonomous and of equal status. There was no paramount chief, no suzerain; no chief could command the actions of another, he could only request. But while the chiefs were individual and independent in authority, their power in the community derived to a large extent from the way in which they operated their authority as a conjoint system (see Social Change in Tikopia , 1959, pp. 255--60, 267--75)."" (Firth, 1970, p. 49)

“It was the Work of the Gods in particular that demonstrated the existence of a ‘national’ pagan Tikopia religion by exemplifying and supporting the common elements of belief and procedure and prescribing complex ritual interaction. It showed how much more there was in the religious system than a set of small-scale individual cults. It was in these collective assemblies that the ritual differentiation of rank of the chiefs was particularly manifest. In all public affairs where seating or food distribution was an index of status, seats and food tended to be allotted in the order of Kafika, Tafua, Taumako, Fangarere; where a different order was followed, some traditional validation was provided (e.g. Work of the Gods , 1967, p. 294). Even when the Ariki Kafika was host his food portion was set out first. This ranking was a reflex not of numerical strength of clans, nor of wealth nor of seniority in age or election, but of traditional ritual functions … The traditional religious hierarchy of the Tikopia chiefs was exemplified in titles, some nominally indicating functional duties. The Ariki Kafika was ‘the standing chief of the land’, the Ariki Tafua was his ‘Worker’, the Ariki Taumako his ‘Watcher’, his maru … [51] … In ritual and general status relations the Ariki Kafika tended to stress his own superior position. He said to me in 1928: ‘The great land (Tikopia as a whole) is the clan of the Ariki Kafika. The chiefs who dwell here are the ritual elders ( pure ) of the Ariki Kafika.’ But this was meant in an analogical sense. The Ariki Kafika was the only chief entitled to recite formulae for the welfare of the whole community; the other chiefs were primarily responsible for the welfare of their own clans. Hence they could be thought to stand in relation to the Ariki Kafika as their own elders stood in relation to them … I have shown the wide scope of a Tikopia chief's conception of his duties and privileges, how his traditional role as a priest was closely linked with his other roles, and how he operated not in isolation but as part of a community structure. But while the chiefs were hierarchically related, each had his own place at the apex of the internal ritual structure of his own clan.” (Firth, 1970, pp. 50-51)",firth1970[31-63]

""The Spaniard created a ‘presidente’ and a ‘vice-presidente’ for the various pueblos he sought to control, but these men, as often Ilokano as Igorot, were the avenue of Spanish approach to the natives – they were almost never the natives’ mouthpiece … Aside from these two pueblo officers the government and control of the pueblo is purely aboriginal. Each ato, of which, as has been noted, there are seventeen, has its group of old men called ‘ĭn-tug-tu’-kan.’ This ĭn-tug-tu’-kan’ is not an organization, except that it is intended to be perpetual, and, in a measure, self-perpetuating. It is a thoroughly democratic group of men, since it is composed of all the old men in the ato, no matter how wise or foolish, rich or poor – no matter what the man’s social standing may be. Again, it is democratic – the simplest democracy – in that it has no elective organization, no headmen, no superiors or inferiors whose status in the ĭn-tug-tu’-kan is determined by the members of the group. The feature of self-perpetuation displays itself in that it decides when the various men of the ato become am-a’-ma, ‘old men,’ and therefore members of ĭn-tug-tu’-kan. A person is told some day to come and counsel with the ĭn-tug-tu’-kan, and thenceforth he is a member of the group.

""In all matters with which the ĭn-tug-tu’-kan deals it is supreme in its ato, but in the ato only; hence the opening statement of the chapter that no man or group of men holds the control of the pueblo. The [168] life of the several ato has been so similar for such a number of generations that, in matters of general interest, the thoughts of one ĭn-tug-tu’-kan will be practically those of all others. For instance, there are eight ceremonial occasions on which the entire pueblo rests from agricultural labors, simply because each ato observes the same ceremonials on identical days … Again, when a person of the pueblo has been killed by another pueblo treacherously or in ambush, or in any way except by fair fight, the pueblo as a unit hastens to avenge the death on the pueblo of the slayer."" (Jenks, 1905, pp. 167-168)

""There is little differentiation of the functions of the ĭn-tug-tu′-kan. It hears, reviews, and judges the individual disagreements of the members of the ato and makes laws by determining custom. It also executes its judgments or sees that they are executed. It makes treaties of peace, sends and accepts or rejects challenges of war for its ato. In case of interato disagreements of individuals the two ĭn-tug-tu′-kan meet and counsel together, representing the interests of the persons of their ato. In other words, the pueblo is a federation made up of seventeen geographical and political units, in each of which the members recognize that their sanest, ripest wisdom dwells with the men who have had the longest experience in life; and the group of old men—sometimes only one man and sometimes a dozen—is known as ĭn-tug-tu′-kan, and its wisdom is respected to the degree that it is regularly sought and is accepted as final judgment, being seldom ignored or dishonored. In matters of a common interest the pueblo customarily acts as a unit. Probably could it not so act, factions would result causing separation from the federation. This state of things is hinted as one of the causes why the ancestors of present Samoki separated from the pueblo of Bontoc. The fact that they did separate is common knowledge, and a cause frequently assigned is lack of space to develop. However, there may have been disagreement."" (Jenks, 1905, p. 168)

Settlement pattern:

""Bontoc and Samoki pueblos, in all essentials typical of pueblos in the Bontoc area, lie in the mountains in a roughly circular pocket called Pa-pas’-kan … Bontoc lies compactly built on a sloping piece of ground, roughly about half a mile square … [49] … Bontoc is composed of seventeen political divisions, called ‘a’-to’ … Each a’-to is a separate political division … The pueblo must be studied entirely through the a’-to. It is only [50] an aggregate of which the various a’-to are the units, and all the pueblo life there is is due to the similarity of interests of the several a’-to.""

18455,kiribati,84,2,149-2,"Settlement pattern and political organization:

The Gilbertese typically lived in hamlets (kainga), each occupied by a totemic kin group. Kainga were grouped into 'maneaba districts', which appear to have corresponded to the 'local community. In most of the Gilbert Islands 'maneaba districts' appear to have been independent, but on a few islands there were 'paramount chiefs'. The following description suggests that religion was largely confined to the kainga:

“In pre-European times the Gilbertese did not live in the large consolidated villages which now characterise their islands. The basic [7] residential unit was the kainga – a hamlet, sometimes walled for privacy, within which a number of related extended families lived in separate mwenge, or households … On the bush (usually the eastern) side of the settlement there was a bangota or shrine to the ancestral gods or spirits recognised by the kainga … Although there was no defined priesthood it was customary for one family from within the kainga to lead worship and to interpret the natural signs – changes in winds and clouds, for example – which were seen as conveying messages from the gods … Each kainga had also had a totemic object – fish or birds were most common – which its members did not hunt or eat. 

“On all islands except Makin and Butaritari, each kainga was associated with a maneaba or meeting-house. Together with subsidiary kawa which had been established when the original settlements had become overcrowded, the kainga of a district were usually scattered along the western, or lagoon, side of an island with most being in close proximity to the maneaba. The maneaba was a large rectangular peaked roof, sometimes more than thirty metres in length and half as wide, set on low coral pillars. It was the social and political centre of its district and also served as a temporary residence for visitors who had no close kin in the district. Within the maneaba, each kainga had a defined sitting place called a boti or inaki. The oldest male of the kainga was usually its head and also its leading spokesman ... In the southern Gilberts some boti leaders were regarded with greater sanctity than others and some kainga were, [8] at least in a practical or military sense, more powerful than their neighbours ... In essence, however, the various boti and the kainga they represented were seen as approximately equal, though competing, elements of a single district community. A man with military prowess might rise to a position of prominence but his leadership was transitory; there was no place for a chiefly dynasty in the southern Gilberts ... [9] ... In the islands stretching northwards from the equator to Marakei, the chiefly system survived the depredations of Kaitu and Uakeia although maneaba councils became an important restraint on chiefly power. In most cases one kainga in each district assumed a pre-eminent position although in practice its leader was more of a warlord than a paramount chief. The maneaba existed with a boti arrangement parallel to that of the southern islands but district government tended to revolve around the chief rather than the maneaba council. Wars in the pursuit of land and power were common and on Abemama-Kuria-Aranuka, and to a lesser extent on Abaiang, centralised leadership emerged. On Abemama and its two satellite islands, however, this authority was only consolidated by a monopoly of trade and its rewards (including firearms) in the 19th century, while on Abaiang a paramount chief did not emerge until after European contact and his power was only effective and unchallenged for brief periods.

“The strong centralised chiefship that unified Butaritari and Makin was an exception in the Gilbert Islands …” (Macdonald, 1982, pp. 6-9)

'Agricultural rituals' (Grimble & Maude, 1989, pp. 7-19)

Grimble (1989) also notes that most communal religious rituals included only one 'totem group', but describes an occasional ceremony that included 'a group of utu allied for political or warlike purposes' ('totem group' and 'utu' presumably refer to the kin groups occupying a kainga). Since this ceremony took place in the maneaba, it presumably involved the kainga of a maneaba district:

""Each separate Gilbertese totem group, as a rule, practiced the cult of its own ancestral deities independently of all others; but in time of famine, a form of ritual meal was practised. All groups united, with the senior male of Karongoa n Uea as the officiating priest, at a stone pillar representing the body of a being named Tabakea, within a maneaba of a particular style called Maungatabu."" (Grimble, 1989, p. 17)

""The cult of Tabakea approaches nearer to the idea of a tribal cult than any other noted heretofore. On occasions of stress, disease, or necessity, when a group of utu allied for political or warlike purposes felt the approach of common danger, a stone about 6 to 9 feet high would be erected in the maneaba .. The senior man of Karongoa n Uea, the clan in the maneaba whose privilege it was to speak the first and last word in assembly, would decide upon a day when all the utu should be gathered together to make offerings (karea) and prayers (tataro) at the stone."" (Grimble, 1989, p. 81)

Grimble and Maude describe other rituals that appear to have been performed by or on behalf of multiple kainga. The 'pandanus ceremony' (Grimble & Maude, 1989, pp. 10-14) appears to have been performed by an individual, but this individual needed to belong to a particular 'clan', which suggests that they may have performed it on behalf of multiple 'clans':

“A highly interesting ritual, in which the Sun and the Moon played a large part, was formerly used for the purpose of ensuring a rich pandanus [11] harvest. The ceremony could be performed only by members of three clans, Karongoa, Ababou, and Maerua.” (Grimble & Maude, 1989, pp. 10-11)

As the excerpts above suggest, religious authority appears to have been vested in kin groups rather than individuals. To the extent that the rights of particular kin groups (such as Karongoa n Uea) to perform ceremonies was recognised throughout the Gilbert Islands, it could be argued that the whole group shared a common religious authority. However, it is not clear that members of one of these clans living in a particular maneaba district had a right to perform rituals on behalf of people living in other districts.

On the predence of Karongoa n Uea in the Gilbert Islands:

“Many clans had hereditary privileges or duties connected with the ceremonial of the maneaba, which they most jealously prized and guarded. Among these, the group of Karongoa n Uea ‘Karongoa of Kings’, as its name suggests, was foremost in rank. Karongoa n Uea was king of the maneaba; at all ceremonial gatherings within the edifice, its chief man—the senior descendant through eldest sons of the original ancestor—assumed ‘the first word and the last word’ in debate … [220] … Attached to Karongoa n Uea was a very clear-cut doctrine of infallibility concerning certain race traditions … [221] … A Gilbertese explanation of the pre-eminence of this clan in the ceremonial of the maneaba is that ‘it is Samoa’; that is to say, it represents the victorious immigration from Samoa into the Gilbert Islands.” (Grimble & Maude, 1989, pp. 219-221)

“Though there can be no doubt that the people of Karongoa n Uea came as conquerors and chiefs to the group, their prestige in the maneaba is now entirely divorced from the idea of temporal power, and their privileges are largely independent of political vicissitudes.

""On Abemama, indeed, where the high chiefs belong to the clan of Kaburara, the insolently despotic Tem Binoka of fifty years ago, whose particular pleasure it was to override all Gilbertese custom and so display his power, became jealous of Karongoa's ceremonial prerogatives and deliberately assumed them to himself. Since then Kaburara has performed on Abemama all the offices in the maneaba that used to be in the hands of Karongoa n Uea …  The deliberate stroke of disorganization which Binoka was obliged to effect on Abemama, in order to rob Karongoa of its precedence, only serves to throw into greater relief the durable character of its privileges, for before their spoliation they had subsisted intact through six successive generations of powerful high chiefs. Their eventual loss for political reasons was quite exceptional, being without parallel on any other Gilbert island. Elsewhere, whatever may have been the accidents of war or other material circumstances, Karongoa remained supreme in the maneaba from the time of the Samoan immigration right up to the coming of the British flag in 1892.” (Grimble, 1989, p. 223)","macdonald1982[6-9];grimble-maude1989[7-19, 81]"

20297,taumako,86,0,150-0,"By the 1930s the entire population of the Taumako Islands was concentrated in one village, Tahua, but previously there had been other settlements:

“In May 1960 the population of Taumako was 220 … This is but a fraction of the number of people that probably lived in the Duff Islands at the turn of the century when serious depopulation first set in. The epidemics that swept across the Santa Cruz Group, the Solomons, and the whole Southwest Pacific seem to have come to Taumako late — not until after 1900. But when they came the results were as disastrous to its population as they were to the population of other Melanesian islands. One by one all settlements but the largest on the artificial islet of Tahua were decimated and abandoned. By the 1930's the entire Duff Island population lived at Tahua. Still, the community there was not as large as it had been when there were villages and hamlets on Aua and, possibly, on other islands as well."" (Davenport, 1968, p. 147)

Tahua village is not described as having had any acknowledged leadership, and this does not appear to have been the case in the past either. The 'wards' (mata) that made up the village seem to have been fully independent:

“The historical conception for the formation of Tahua Island, as mentioned before, is that each house site was built up and established as a result of immigration [Page 158] from a community located elsewhere in the Duff Group. As the ward groupings grew, they were regarded either as extensions of communities located elsewhere or the entire community transplanted from elsewhere to Tahua islet. With the consolidation of the entire Duff Island population at Tahua as a result of the frightful depopulation and Governmental encouragement, this process completed itself. With the final consolidation each ward came to be regarded, in part at least, as the historical remnant of a former community. As such, each of the wards regards itself today as a fully corporate association of households.” (Davenport, 1968, pp. 157-158)

Leadership of the wards was clearly informal:

""Headship to a men's house association (or in other words the leadership of a ward group) was neither by formal election nor by heredity. The most active among the senior men living in a ward was its de facto head. When he died or became too old to be an effective leader, he was succeeded by the next senior man, who was also respected for his energy and leadership. There seems to have been very little competition among men of a ward over who was formal head of the group. Therefore, the group of men who headed the men's house associations were the leaders of the entire society. Amongst them, however, there was considerable competition as to the relative wealth and status of entire wards, and this competition was shared by all of the members of their respective associations. Thus, each men's house association was a unit of primary personal identity for its male members. It was also, as shall be shown, a unit of close economic cooperation. This source of identity also reinforced the corporate solidarity of the ward group.

“Looked at from the angle of a political group, the men's houses association, like the ward group it represents, has as its constituents households, not individuals. It is true that women were not considered to be parties to the men's house associations (although they were not barred altogether from entering the structures), but their domestic interests are represented outside the household [173] by their husbands and fathers. Furthermore, any major activity instituted by the men's house association usually required major contributory efforts of all of the women of its constituent households … The most ambitious economic effort of Taumako, and one in which the men's house associations figured most prominently, was the construction of the famous trading canoes called te puki … The decision to build a new puki was usually made by one man or at most two men in a partnership. As a rule the men who decided to organize the construction were the leading men, those who were heads of men's house associations, by virtue of the fact that those men were the most ambitious, showed the most initiative and were the best organizers.” (Davenport, 1968, pp. 171-172)

Social groups below the 'ward' level were 'dwelling sites', 'households', and 'siblingships'. 

Dwelling sites usually had only one household living on them (Davenport (1968, pp. 154-155, 'Table 2. Tahua Islet wards, house sites, households and number of occupants'), whose head was usually also the owner of the land:

“Each named dwelling site is individually owned, usually but not always, by the man who heads the household occupying it. In theory, dwelling sites are indivisible, thus, they must be inherited or transmitted intact from one owner to the next. There is concern over preserving linear continuity across generations in the ownership of dwelling sites. Thus, an eldest son inherits the site from his father. If there is no son, then a daughter inherits; if there are no children to inherit, first preference goes to a sister's son or a sister's daughter. Only as a last resort does a dwelling pass to a collateral relative, a brother, sister, or a cross-cousin.” (Davenport, 1968, p. 154)

“Although a dwelling site can never be divided, more than one household may occupy a single site. Four sites, H. Hiua, H. Tetoha, H. Alo, and H. Tangalau have two and three households built on them. In each of these cases the owner of the site has permitted a friend or relative to build there, but doubling up in no way constitutes a splitting of the title or the creation of a new house site.” (Davenport, 1968, p. 156)

Households were overwhelmingly occupied by nuclear families:

""The entire Taumakoan population lives in 40 households, 39 of which are located on 34 named dwelling sites of Tahua islet. The distribution of household sizes is summarized in Table 1. Thirty-nine of these households consist of a single nuclear family (30 are composed of a married couple and their children; two are composed of married couples without children; seven are composed of a widowed mother and her children). In 14 instances of these 39 households other close unmarried relatives are also included as dependents. In most cases the dependents are those of the husband — his unmarried siblings or his deceased sibling's children. All of these 39 nuclear-family type households contain no more than two generations. One additional household contains three generations. It consists of a widowed father, his two unmarried daughters, his unmarried son, a married son and his wife and their two daughters."" (Davenport, 1968, p. 153)

'Siblingships' were sets of brothers and their unmarried sisters, headed by the eldest brother, who acted as their 'representative' on certain occasions. This approaches an 'extended family' type of organization, but does not quite meet it since it is not clear that the head of a siblingship represented the families of his brothers rather than just his brothers:

""One facet of kinship indicated neither by the reference nomenclature nor the kinship role categories is the strong solidarity of siblings, and particularly the solidarity among brothers. Among brothers the eldest is accorded a special status as head of the siblingship, which he represents on certain occasions. One such occasion is a feast distribution in which the initial division of food is made to the eldest brother of each siblingship. After receiving the food on behalf of his siblings, the eldest brother redivides it and sends to each sibling his portion. Married sisters who are living with their husbands, however, do not receive a portion in this type of distribution, but a widowed or divorced sister does. It is as though a married woman is no longer a full member of her own siblingship, but a member of her husband's siblingship.

""As already indicated, the eldest brother is certain to be the one selected by his father to inherit and occupy the named house site. This provides the preferred kind of agnatic continuity for the house site, and at the same time recognizes the principal of primogeniture within siblingships.” (Davenport, 1968, pp. 166)",davenport-1968

(Barnes, 1974, pp. 92-93)

""In Leuwajang, the responsibility for the everyday affairs of government lies not with Ape Utung but with the clan Ape Labi ... Today the village head bears the title Kepala Desa Gaja Baru, or Head of the New Form Village. ... During the Dutch period, and until 1960, he seems to have borne the title Kepala Kampung, which means simply 'Village Head'. These are all Indonesian terms and are of external imposition. The title as such seems to have no equivalent in the indigenous language, and the office itself seems not to have existed in former times. Its historical antecedents are now difficult to trace with certainty. Before the Dutch take-over the men who exercised power similar to that of the village head were war-leaders and designated by the term mier rian ... The war-leader of the Belu (meo) is simply a brave man who gathers a group of younger men around him (Vroklage 1952: 1: 646); and the equivalent in East Flores (ata berkint) is a person of singular aggressiveness and bravery, not an inherited status. There is [94] comparative reason, then to question whether the office of mier rian was necessarily always in the same clan.

""In answer to this, there is very little information. The only mier rian now remember ion Leuwajang were the last two and they both were in Ape Labi. The second of these seems even to have been appointed to the position, and the first seems to have had an authority in village affairs not confined to times of war ... Given then that the historical problems cannot be solved, I would like to suggest the following speculative reconstruction. No certainty is claimed for it, however ... The lord of the land ... according to this version, employed members of the other clans as delegates to arrange external affairs. When the Dutch came in, they misunderstood the situation and appointed these delegates as village head ... I suggest then that in Kédang the léu-auq wala formerly had primary authority in affairs concerning the welfare of the village, but that he was devoid of executive responsibility. His authority was, as we have seen, primarily spiritual. Nevertheless, ultimately executive power may have been answerable to him in a way that it is not now. The distinction between the two corresponded, as it does in East Flores, to the distinction between the inside and the outside. Though internal, spiritual authority was clearly [95] invested in a single, hereditarily transmitted office, responsibility for temporal affairs may not have been so specifically attached to a single office or clan. The primary problem of temporal government may well have been the successful prosecution of war. It is unthinkable that the léu-auq wala should actually serve as war-leader. That task was left then to men who showed especial strength of body and personality. These may well have appeared in any clan. As war-leader they were clearly delegates of the lord of the land; a war undertaken by the village should be under his ultimate direction. Temporal matters other than war would easily enough be delegated to those who had distinguished themselves by their leadership in war. Thus, a distinction between internal authority and external execution should have led to a more or less enduring investment of temporal power in a given individual.” (Barnes, 1974, pp 93-95)

""Tribal groups (butubutu) in Roviana are headed by chiefs (bangara) and at the village level, elders (palabatu), who exercise control over access to land and sea resources within ancestral estates (pepeso)."" (Thomas, 2003, p. 58)

Overview of leadership positions:

“Following Keesing (1985), Roviana leadership can be thought of in terms of three dimensions of control: ability in managing a ritual sphere of communication with ancestral spirits; demonstration of power through violence; and ability in social management and wealth accumulation. Keesing argues that, in Malaita, these elements were idealised types or paths leaders might fit or follow - a successful person could become a priest, a warrior, or an entrepreneur depending on their natural disposition and personal choice ... The Roviana case seems similarly to revolve around these dimensions, with established positions of hiama (priest), tie varane (warrior), palabatu (village heads or elders) and bangara."" (Thomas, 2003, p. 103)

Priests:

""The role of hiama in Roviana included tending shrines and conducting ceremonial rites – they would burn offerings, handle crania and shell valuables, and ritually communicate with tomate … Most accounts of hiama come from Simbo and seldom mention whether the position could ever be inherited – in Roviana the case is a little clearer. Genealogical information suggests that at one time bangara and hiama duties were conducted by the same person. Schneider (1996: 223) argues that a separation into different offices soccurred shortly after the rule of Qorabele, with the brothers Hiqebangara and Hipobangara becoming hiama and bangara respectively … From this point onwards the genealogical data show that hiama status was transferred to descent group members. But this relatives primarily to a kind of ‘paramount hiama’ – the principal ritual specialists of the Roviana polity (ngati hiama) – rather than persons selected by minor hamlets for the tending of specific shrines, or upon specific occasions. (Thomas, 2003, p. 112)

More on high priests:

""Butubutu members had rights to access emata – tracts of land that had been cultivated by previous generations, where family gardens (inuma) could be established … The role of ngati hiama was to conduct ceremonies at garden shrines to supplicate tamasa and hence ensure that the earth within emata was fertile – particularly at times when people felt that crops were not growing well, because, having been neglected, the tamasa were ‘cool’ (sa lomoso na tamasa). Hocart (1922: 284-9) describes a round of fertility ceremonies on Simbo whereby hiama visited various tamasa shrines … [249] … As noted above, similar ceremonies occurred in Roviana at various local hope mangini (the name is significant, metaphorically indicating the shrine’s purpose in making the tamasa and soil ‘hot’ (mangini) again). Often such fertility rites would be conducted by minor hiama at shrines on emata used by local family groups, but for matters that concerned all Kazukuru land the ngati hiama held ceremonies at a central, apical garden shrine, which in Riabule’s time was at Vatada, Munda … The ngati hiama acted in these ceremonies of fertility and clearance as a mediator (tie varikarovae), using an inherited ability to enjoin a response from tamasa for the well-being of the community. (Thomas, 2005, pp. 248-249)

""According to the above, we can think of minor hiama … as ‘children’ of the ngati hiama … or rather, as genealogically conceived elements of their distributed personhood … A ngati hiama was revealed as such only during moments of encompassment, during ceremonies at the central shrine when he acted as an overarching ‘one’ on helaf, and with the force, of ‘many’: the many ancestral ngati hiama, and the many [252] minor hiama distributed with local garden shrines throughout the lands of the butubutu (not to mention the wider community invested in the ceremonies.""

21166,tanna,86,3,150-3,"‘Tanna: Stones within canoes’ (Bonnemaison, 1994, pp. 103-191)

Tanna was divided into many local groups called niko, 'canoes', that shared a 'dancing place' and appear to have constituted 'patrilocal clans'. These 'canoes' were often part of larger units that were also called 'canoes':

“For the most part, the population is scattered in small groups of houses along grassy trails in the bush or a wooded landscape dominated by coconut groves on the coast and tree ferns in the inland hills. Houses are also found near the dirt or coral roads that circle the island and cross it in one spot ... Near each small group of huts or houses is a dancing place, nakamal in Bislama or yimwayim in the language of Tanna's west coast ... Every day, men meet here at nightfall to drink kava together ... [108] The individuals who meet daily make up the core of a local group, a 'canoe' or niko as it is called on the island, which itself is often linked to a larger 'canoe' made up of several patrilocal clans sharing the same territory and mythical heritage.” (Bonnemaison, 1994, pp. 106-108)

Bonnemaison (1994, p. 140, Map 9: 'The Land Canoes: Traditional territories and groups in Tanna') provides a map of the 'canoes' into which Tanna is divided, and the 'dancing places' within them. I estimate that about 40 of them contained more than one dancing place (a more precise count is difficult because of the resolution of the map), and some of them contained more than 10. 

There were three 'explicitly defined social functions' in Tannese society, which appear to have operated at the 'canoe' level. Only one, the yani niko, appears to have been associated with political leadership. These roles appear to have been vested in clans, but vested in individuals:

“In 1977 and 1978, when political issues and conflicts over land tenure (which I examine later) brought turmoil to the central part of Tanna, local customary groups endeavored to create a political system ... To my surprise, the pagans’ strategy was to look for the ‘aristocracy of the origins’ ... After recollecting the primordial sacred places through which humans, then food, had emerged on the island, the pagans designated the genuine keepers of such places as the big men of kastom. Real power accrued to them. The yani niko 'voices of the canoe' were granted political authority. Because they represent the ‘first men’ who have emerged from the stones, they are naturally in command of the political sphere as masters of Tanna's discourse ... The ‘voices of the canoe’ are also seen as the ‘surveyors’ of territory and the authorities on land sharing, internal boundaries, and external borders ... [131] ... After the yani niko come the naotupunus, in other words, the local clans associated with the networks of places whose magical powers stem from stones of agrarian fertility ... Life on Tanna rests on their magical activity. On the other hand, their connection with the sacred world of food excludes such clans from the political sphere. They have no ‘voice,’ only a type of power that is also a form of duty. Just as the yani niko clans represent the ‘voices of the canoe,’ the naotupunus clans are its ‘belly’. Thus Tanna’s first community seems to have evolved with a dual perspective: the forces of nature are split between masculine and feminine principles and, likewise, the original society itself is divided into male clans that rule the political sphere and female clans that rule the sphere of food-related magic.” (Bonnemaison, 1994, pp. 130-131)

“According to the island's oral traditions, Tannese society includes three explicitly defined social functions. These functions correspond to three groups of different status involved in separate types of activity; they can also be seen as three images of power. Keeping at the front of the canoe, the yremera is the canoe's ‘honor’ and living emblem. As such, his power—symbolized by the hawk—is linked with great ceremonial exchanges, the sharing of food, and the control of the traditional roads of alliance that allow for these activities. The yani niko or ‘voice of the canoe’ represents political will: keeping at the back of the canoe, he steers it in war times. He has authority over the territory, because he is heir to the ‘first man’ who appeared on it. Indeed, the yani niko keeps land for the others and is in charge of land sharing. His role is to highlight the yremera's glory and to speak on his behalf. Finally, the naotupunus works with agrarian magic: he holds the sacred powers immersed [151] in the canoe's places and is the sanctioned mediator of supernatural forces. As the canoe's belly, he keeps in the middle.

“First comes the honor, second the political will, third the magic. In metaphorical terms, the yremera is the canoe's emblem, the yani niko its helmsman, and the naotopunus its belly. hile the tradition of the 'voices of the canoe' (yani niko) originated on the western side of the island, notably in the Ipai area which gave birth to the Semo-Semo myth, the hawk tradition, that of the yremera, gave rise to a second society on the eastern side, in the Ipeukel (Embuitoka) area. The hawk tradition may be linked with the phenomenon of the Polynesian outliers and therefore with a cultural influence from Samoa or Tonga. This influence is particularly obvious in the White Sands area, notably with respect to the local language (D. Tryon, pers comm). With its equality-based ideology and its ‘voices of the canoe’ as masters of the land, the myth of the nepro corresponds to a very ancient Melanesian tradition. More recent are the symbols of the kweriya (hawk) and the tapa belt (tut) which, along with their honor-based ideology, may have appeared in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries AD, or perhaps later, two or three hundred years ago. Mwatiktiki, Kasiken's father, is the first Polynesian hero ... These two traditions also differ from the standpoint of the transfer of titles. Within the original lineage of each canoe, clan elders choose the yani niko on the basis of their human and intellectual qualities—their actual title is irrelevant. By contrast, an yremera receives his title as a child: he is neither ‘elected’ nor chosen but receives his power through the height of his title.” (Bonnemaison, 1994, pp. 150-151)

In the nineteenth century most of the island's population was affiliated with one of two 'moieties' or 'phratries'. It is not clear how long this system had been in place, but Bonnemaison describes it as a 'late addition'. Initially each 'canoe' contained members of both moieties, but over the course of the nineteenth-century the moieties became increasingly territorial:

“According to the ideology that prevails in eastern Tanna, the two moieties - Koyometa and Numurkuen - are phratries that correspond to two brothers born of the Tangalua lineage (the sea snake) whose founding places are at Yaneumwakel on the east coast, and whose consonance, related myths, and symbols are Polynesian. This is further indication that the moiety system is a late addition, which occurred soon after the kweriya and the yremera chieftainships were introduced ... [154] ... Exchanges of women from one moiety to the other validated the return of peace in the context of alliance rituals occurring after a war cycle. As a consequence, a third group carrying the ‘blood’ of both moieties gradually appeared. That phratry is called Nuolaklak in Middle Bush and Kouatkasua in White Sands. The Nuolaklak's role is to serve as a liaison between the ‘two canoes.’ They carry the message of one to the other and facilitate the arrival of peace. In practice, they are often accused of playing the opposite role by stirring up hatred, spreading falsehoods, and spying ... Each land canoe integrates the principles of this dual society. One or the other phratry predominates within each such canoe; in principle, the minority moiety is welcome but stands aside in relation to the controlling moiety. The exceptions to this rule are twelve strong nodes on the political network where the two roads intersect. There, Numurkuen and Koyometa live together as equals … Theoretically, the two moieties co­exist but do not merge. The places of one and the other are separate, and each interacts more frequently with the corresponding groups in the neighboring territory than with the adverse groups within its own territory. During the tense or conflict­ridden times of the past, the two parts of the canoe used to clash. At other times, one side tended to believe that the other was the source of all problems [155] Nineteenth-­century wars between phratries led to the partitioning of the original territories and, in most cases, to the eviction of the minority. Yet the 'law of the two canoes' had not called upon the phratries to separate. On the contrary, they were meant to live together on both sides of the same dancing places. The two networks had not been created to shed blood but to surpass themselves and do 'great things' through permanent competition, including, but not limited to, ritualized warfare.” (Bonnemaison, 1994, pp. 153-155)

The moieties were loosely organized confederacies led by 'big men', and their only function appears to have been warfare:

“The split into two moieties or phratries, Koyometa and Numurkuen, was well accepted initially, and was perfectly adapted to the network based 'road' system. The ideology of the two big canoes penetrated to the core of each local canoe as it helped create two groups with a distinct political identity in each mesh of the net. Two continuous chains of alliance now circled the island. Whenever the Numurkuen of a specific canoe were in conflict with their Koyometa counterparts, they asked all island Numurkuen to settle the dispute in their place; the Koyometa did likewise. The code of alliance became simpler and even more efficient, and messages circulated freely among allies with the same political identity ...[164] ... Thanks to the allied phratries, the open circulation process represented a shift toward greater political unity on the island. No longer was society made up of one hundred autonomous, even anarchical canoes. Now two mimetic moieties encompassing all canoes were supervised in a few strong nodes by big men who constantly interacted with one another ... The whole system rested on their interaction. Those big men, both Koyometa and Numurkuen, controlled their own local groups; they initiated warfare and halted it at will. The quality of their agreement upheld the social order. In other words, kastom now reflected a type of power whose dual nature implied a dialogue between its leaders. But this involved a great risk: if the dialogue stopped, the 'war among canoes' could take a turn for the worse.” (Bonnemaison, 1994, pp. 164-165)

NOTE: Lindstrom (1978) describes Tanna as having only two inherited statuses: Ierumanu ('ruler') and Ienientete ('spokesman of the canoe'). Presumably these correspond to Bonnemaison's 'yremera' and ''yani niko'. According to Lindstrom political power on Tanna, at least at time of writing, was largely in the hands of 'big men' whose power was personal and achieved, and the titles were merely 'pawns in bigman games' (Lindstrom does, however, leave open the possibility that they may have been more important previously). 

“There are also two inherited chiefly statuses in traditional society: the Ierumanu (‘ruler’) and the Ienientete (‘spokesman of the canoe’). These are the Tannese versions of the Polynesian sacred and talking chiefs. The ideal roles of each chiefly status also admit a Polynesian character. The Ierumanu does not involve himself in daily political maneuvering he rarely speaks at meetings; he does not fight in wars. This is all left to the Ienientete who, nevertheless, has a lower status than the Ierumanu (but cf. Guiart 1956:88 who says the opposite) … The Ierumanu and Ienientete statuses do not of themselves guarantee political authority. Only in the situation where such a status holder is also a bigman do they mean much politically (outside of a few ceremonial occasions, such as the nokwiari). These two statuses are, in fact, pawns in bigman games. Most bigmen attempt to appropriate one or the other of them. If a man is not lucky enough to inherit clear rights to a chiefly title he can manipulate geneology or share the status with several other claimants. The fact that, in many cases, rights to a chiefly title are disputed, the high frequency of male adoption, the classificatory kinship system all serve to loosen the situation and allow the game to proceed.

“Many bigmen become Ierumanu or Ienientete after they are first bigmen ... [135] ... Inherited titles may have been of greater political import in traditional society. The importance of inherited status in a context of endemic warfare is unclear. Watt's observation which heads this paper (she settled on Tanna in 1869) provides some evidence against the presence of powerful chiefs with inherited positions."" (Lindstrom, 1978, p. 135)

Adams (1984) on the 'yeremwanu' and 'yani en dete' of nineteenth-century Tanna:

“Like Europeans before him, Paton sought out the chiefs with whom to barter for goods, land or protection. The men usually singled out were yeremwanu, distinguished by the impressive feathered head-dress – kayoo – which they wore on ceremonial occasions ... [15] ... As the missionary Turner was to discover, to give presents to seven or eight chiefs was to offend seventy or eighty ‘petty chiefs’. He found that in a village of eighty to a hundred inhabitants there were at least one or two yeremwanu who, along with the ‘heads of families’, regulated local affairs, and whose authority did not extend beyond ‘a gunshot from his own dwelling’ ... [15] ... What exasperated missionaries like Turner, Paton and Watt was that the yeremwanu’s right to wear the kayo, though a significant privilege in a ritual-oriented society like Tanna’s, did not correspond to a political role in the Western sense. Ultimate authority appears to have rested with assemblies where individuals would argue for hours and days until a consensus was reached. Those yeremwanu who were most influential in the assemblies appear to have exercised power and authority according to other social roles. Kuanuan, an influential Neraimene yeremwanu in the Port Resolution area, in addition to wearing the kayo, could also feast on the head of the turtle and practice atmospheric and agrarian magic ... Manuman, another important Neraimene yeremwanu, could practice nahak sorcery, and the two principal yeremwanu at Kwamera, to the south, were also renowned magicians … Early in 1862 Kapuku, as a sign of his acceptance of Christianity, handed over to the missionary Matheson twenty sacred stones, including stones for war, the sea, sickness and storms. Nearly a century later, the anthropologist Guiart found that of Tanna’s 472 yeremwanu, just 140 had only the privilege of wearing the kayo: 235 could also feast on the head of the turtle, twenty-seven could supervise the cooking of the smooth pig, thirteen were masters of the nekawa tpungu (a special variety of piper methysticum), three could take part in cannibal feasts, and 106 were magicians.

“The early missionaries to Tanna were patronized by important yeremwanu like Kuanuan; but in times of unrest, such as the great epidemic of measles in 1861, they survived only by the intervention of the yani en dete or war chief, whose single material privilege as a yani en dete was a black and red penis wrapper. In times of peace, Turner observed, the war chief had little [16] influence over the ‘common people’, and worked in his garden ‘just like common men’. But in times of war he was responsible for the group’s safety. He was warned of threats, he knew the routes the enemy would follow, and he negotiated to ward off potential threats or confirm and strengthen alliances. If it were necessary, he decided the flight route, passing through the territory of allies of his choice. In the assemblies he was the last to speak, which meant that he had the final say in decision-making. The war chief’s skill and strength lay in determining at what point discussion could be finalized and the consensus summed up; his authority could be challenged by another person subsequently rising and disputing that the final position had been reached.

“That the yani en dete summed up the group’s collective will is suggested in the English term sometimes used to designate the person: the ‘mouth-piece’ or ‘talking chief’ ... The designation mouth-piece also suggests that the yani en dete’s authority lasted only for as long as he expressed the tribe’s collective will – a suggestion which is confirmed by events at Port Resolution in 1861, when the two principal yani en dete were unable to convince their fellow tribesmen of the need to go to war ... [17] ... In these two cases traditional authority relations had been upset by European intervention: at other times the yani en dete appears to have had a greater say in questions of war and peace. For instance, when a small girl was killed in a raid by enemies of the Loinio tribe (on the west coast) late in the nineteenth century, the victim’s father did all he could to stir the tribe into a war of revenge. But Iavis, the yani en dete, refused to sanction any fighting. So long as he was war chief, Frank Paton recorded, there could be no war; so the war party attempted to depose Iavis and put another man in his place. But no other name could command such authority and Iavis remained the War Chief of Loinio ... The role is implied in the title yani en dete, literally ‘master of the canoe’ ... [18] ... Both in a metaphysical and in more practical ways, the group’s destiny was tied to the master of the canoe. And as a rule there was only one such person in each tribe. But, again, it is difficult to point to a clearly defined political role. As Miaki’s abortive call to battle in 1861 indicated, the yani en dete’s authority could lapse if he misread the will of his followers; and even when he could count on his group’s backing, it would appear that factors other than his position of office helped determine his influence ... Judging by Miaki, the important yani en dete had many wives. Many were renowned magicians – Miaki could bring rain and make the yams grow. Noward, the yani en dete for the Nepikinamame could make the sun shine and the bananas ripen. Others could cook the smooth pig, eat the head of the turtle, take part in cannibal feasts.” (Adams, 1984, pp. 14-18)",bonnemaison1994[103-191]

19219,nendo,86,1,150-1,"In the Encyclopaedia of World Cultures, Davenport denies the presence of any 'political offices':

""Political Organization: Traditionally, the basic political
unit was the set of households (one to twenty or more) whose male heads belonged to the same men's association. One or more men's associations, in a loose confederation, formed a village, and most villages, over time, became incorporated to the extent that they controlled and defended a bounded territory. Such was the corporate district. Most districts were hostile to each other, but alliances between men's associations of different districts made it possible for men to cross the boundaries ... [292] ... There were no political offices. Each men's association was governed, autocratically, by its most influential senior men (big-men); district policies and interdistrict relations were handled by informal groups of senior men. Personal rivalries among senior men were common, and this constant tension led to divisiveness and fighting at each political level."" (Davenport, 1991, p 291-292). 

However, in 'Social structure of Santa Cruz', a more detailed source, Davenport mentions something that approaches our definition of political authority. 'Extended families' consisted of multiple nuclear-family households and cooperated in a range of economic endeavours under the direction of a 'senior agnate':

“Beyond the range of the nuclear family household, and the infrequent joint-family domestic arrangement, there is a strong, well-knit extended family organization. Extended families vary in size, strength, and degree of cohesion, yet they figure prominently in just about every activity or undertaking. Sometimes they consist of two generations, sometimes three; sometimes they embrace only married siblings, yet they may include male patrilateral parallel cousins. Such variations are determined by these principles: fathers, sons, and brothers invariably form extended family groups, clustered about and under the authority of the senior male agnate. Male patrilateral parallel cousins are included only as long as one [71] of the senior males of the linking siblingship still lives. This is to say, the extended family must cohere around a living male who is either a lineal (i.e., father, father's father) or a brother of a lineal (i.e., father's brother, father's father's brother). The extended family, then, consists of the households of males who are lineal descendants of a male siblingship of which one member still lives. This eliminates households of sister's children and, therefore, cross-cousins; and because it must form around a living man, the group does not go on expanding as might a localized lineage. In-marrying wives of the men of an extended family have a primary allegiance to their husbands' families, but they are also called upon from time to time to assist their brothers and fathers in some of the undertakings of their extended families, and this may involve the marginal participation of their husbands as well.

“The extended family, having as its point of reference a living, senior male agnate, may seem to be a minimal lineage. Indeed, it is this if we assume that lineage differentiation occurs with the death of brothers of a siblingship, after which the households of descending males become independent from each other. But when an extended family divides into separate units, each with its own senior agnate as director of its affairs, these divisions become completely independent of one another. Fission, not segmentation, has occurred. The fission is demonstrated by a complete separation of the activities over which the extended family extends its authority. The family exercises control over bride-prices and marriage; it supervises and cooperates in maturation observances for its youngsters; it serves in the distribution of garden lands, and as a unit of distribution of food at feasts. Fission, rather than segmentation, is easily accomplished, because of the indifference to genealogical reckoning."" (Davenport, 1964, pp. 70-71)",davenport1964

At first the chief was priest and king … that is to say, he received divine honours while wielding the temporal authority. But as the tribe grew the temporal power became irksome to him … In order to rid himself of the cares of government, he constituted his brother his hereditary minister, and bequeathed to his descendants an ornamental and dignified retirement … [61] ... In Fiji, the process of scission was found in every stage of evolution. Among the Melanesian tribes of the interior it had not begun; in Rewa the spiritual Roko Tui still wielded the temporal power; in Mbau and Thakaundrove he was beginning to lose even the veneration due to his rank … The constitution of Mbau may be taken as a type of the Fijian constitution. First in rank was the Roko Tui Mbau (Sacred Lord of Mbau). His person was sacred. He never engaged personally in war. He was the special patron of the priests, who, in return, were unstinting in their insistence on his divinity … Next in rank came the temporal of chief, the Vu-ni-valu … who was at once Commander-in-Chief and executive sovereign. He never consulted the Roko Tui Mbau in temporal affairs, and he enjoyed tabu privileges little inferior to those paid to his spiritual suzerain … [62] The Tunitonga, the hereditary advisor and spokesman of the chiefs, ranked next … The Mbete (priests) and Mata-ni-vanua (Royal messengers, lit. Messengers of the land) were next in consequence, though the chiefs of the Fisher septs wielded influence in proportion to their force of character.

“Each sept had its own quarter of the town … Across the narrow straits were the planting lands of the subject tribes, who might be seen at every low tide, wading across the ford with contributions of food.” (Thompson, 1908, pp 60-62)",thomson1908[60-61]

20421,rotuma,86,3,150-3,"‘Districts and their government’ (Gardiner, 1898a, pp. 428-431)

‘The sou and his officers’ (Gardiner, 1898b, pp. 460-466)

Rotuma was divided into seven 'districts', each of which appears to have consisted of a number of 'villages', each of which consisted of one 'hoag' (kin group). The hoag had a leader called the pure whose role appears to have included settling conflicts within the hoag. Each district had a head, the gagaja, who was assisted by a council and whose functions included dispute resolution and the organisation of economic and military endeavours. Finally, the island had a 'government' consisting of a 'council' headed by a figure called the fakpure:

""The island was formerly sharply divided up into five districts, Noatau to the east, Faguta to the south, ltoteu to the west, and to the north Malaha and Oinafa ... Later Itoinotu (the part cut off) was separated from Itoteu, leaving a part to the west still belonging to Itoteu, but completely separated from it by the new district ... Faguta was divided into two districts, Pepji and Juju, by the other districts after a successful war, to weak-en the power of its chief.

""Each district has a chief of its own, the gagaja, but the chiefs of Noatau and Faguta were the most important and practically ruled over the north and south sides of the island. The government of the whole island was in the hands of a council, formed of the chiefs of the several districts, when they were not at war with one another. The president of this council was the chief of whichever of these two districts, Noatau and Faguta, had conquered the other in the last war; he was called the fakpure. The office of gagaja in each district always remained in the same family; when one died the heads of the families, or hoag, in the district met together and proceeded to elect the most worthy of the same hoag to the office. The hoag then met, and invariably conferred on him the family name; he would be generally the brother, son of an elder brother, or son of the last [429] chief ... The districts were subdivided into hoag, a name applied to all the houses of a family, which were placed together, forming, if the family was a large one, a small village; it is also applied to the family itself. Each of these hoag had a name, which was conferred on one member of the hoag, who was invariably ipso facto its head, or pure ... In most cases, however, the name was given to a brother of the la pure or its oldest member of pure descent, the husband of one of its women not being, appointed its pure or given its name ... [430] ... The power of the gagaja in his district was not arbitrary; he was assisted by a council of the possessors of the hoag names, which might reverse any action of his. Conflicts between the chief and his council were rare so long as his decisions were in accordance with, and he did not infringe, the Rotuman customs. He was called upon to decide disputes about land between hoag, (or within a hoag, if its pure could not settle it; disputes between individuals of different hoag were referred to him. He could call out the district for fish-driving, war, or any work in which all were interested, and had the power of fining any individuals who did not come. If the walls or paths of his district were in disrepair, he ordered out all the hoag, interested, to do the work; he had further to keep a watch to see that a proper number of cocoanut trees were planted, and that all the papoi land was cultivated.” (Gardiner, 1898a, pp. 428-430)

One of the duties of the fakpure and the island council was to care for the sou (sau according to Howard), whose role appears to have been exclusively religious:

""The head chief of the island, or fakpure, was also one of the officers of a spiritual chief, who was termed the sou, but who really had little to do with the government of the island, and  who lived wherever he was placed by the fakpure and the other chiefs. The position seems to have been directly comparable to that of the how of Tonga,' but, while the latter had considerable temporal power, the sou had none ... [461] ... The sou ... had as attendants a number of officers whose duty it [462] was to protect him, at the risk of their own lives, eveiu if he was fighting with their own districts; they were drawn out of all the districts and supposed to be representative men of eah … Their names or titles were in order of precedence mua (chief priest), hagnata, titopu, fakpure (head chief), fanhoga (wife to sou), fahoa, fagata, tonhida (messenger), and mafuida (the presiding officer over all feasts) …  The duty of the sou was simply to see after the proper  performance of the various feasts, all of which had some religious rites. He was however in no way under the priests, of the different atua (p. 468), nor does he seem to have had any coninection with them. It was his business to preside over the feasts, aiid, whatever might be desired, he had to pray for at the same time as he poured out the kava to the god ... [463] ... Of the other officers, the hctgnata, titopu, fahoa, and fagatla  formed with some of their people a special guard for the sou, always accompanying him; they usually belonged to four several districts."" (Gardiner, 1898b, pp. 460-463)

Gardiner provides little detail about the other functions of the island government, but Dillon, whom Gardiner quotes, describes the chiefs and 'president' of the island as meeting in 'congress' and 'hearing and settling grievances'. 

""This island is divided into six districts, each ruled by its own chief. 'These meet in congress every six months, when they elect a president and deliberate upon state affairs, hearing and settling grievances without having recourse to arms. Thus intestine broils seldom occur, and when they are inevitable are not very sanguinary."" (Dillon, 1829, quoted in Gardiner, 1898a, p. 400)",gardiner-1898a;gardiner-1898b

19229,ngaju,84,2,149-2,"‘The divine order’ (Scharer, 1963, pp. 39-97)

'The Priestly group (utus oloh balian basir)’ (Scharer, 1963, pp. 53-59)

Schärer calls the principal religious figures basir and balian (priests and priestesses). Their role and characteristics are described as follows:

""The most interesting group, sociologically and religiously, in the society is that of the balian and basir, priestesses and priests.""  (Schärer, 1963, p 53)

""On the one hand, the regard in which the balian are held in society is high. They are necessary, they are employed in every fashion, and they are favoured by the law in every respect. Offences against them are punished doubly (Hardeland, dictionary). On the other hand, though, it is felt to be shameful if a daughter or relative becomes a balian"". (Schärer, 1963, p. 56)

“The position of the basir in the community agrees generally with that of the balian … [57] … The basir are composed of hermaphrodites and impotent men. They are popularly regarded exactly as are the balian: on the one hand they are honoured, on the other despised, and it is regarded as similarly shameful if a son or relative becomes a basir.” (Scharer, 1963, pp. 56-57)

""The balian and basir are those called and singled out by the sangiang as mediators between the two primeval mythical groups, i.e. between Maharaja Sangiang and Maharaja Buno, without belonging especially to either one. They belong to both. Their religious mediation reminds one strongly of the role played by the slaves in the major religious ceremonies of the whole community. They travel on behalf of one group in order to invite the leading figures of the other to the feast and the ceremony. Like the slaves, the balian and basir belong to the entire community."" (Schärer, 1946, p 58)

Schiller (1997, pp 39-42, ‘Ritual specialists’) provides a somewhat different account. According to Schiller, the term basir was applied to both male and female specialists, though the latter were rare or non-existent at time of writing. Some basir were transvestites, but this was not common and apparently never had been. Balian was not a kind of specialist but rather a ritual chant led by the basir. Basir was not really an office – differences in religious knowledge between them and laypeople were of ‘degree rather than kind’. However becoming a basir upu (‘head specialists’), who led groups of basir in balian appears to have required a public initiation. Schiller also makes a passing reference to ‘other specialists’, who appear to have been less important.

""Performance of the second and third stages of death ritual is the domain of the basir …. The literature on specialists suggests that they defy typification … Today there are few, if any, female basir."" (Schiller, 1997, pp. 39-40)

""Hans Scharer proposed that basir are nearly exclusively hermaphroditic or impotent (1963, 57), a suggestion strikingly unlike the reputation that many specialists enjoy today. Contemporary specialists acknowledge the existence of transvestite basir but suggest that these have always been uncommon …. Among the Ngaju, it is the degree rather than the kind of knowledge that distinguishes specialists from lay adherents of the indigenous religion and enables them to assume featured roles in the performance of certain types of [41] ritual. Their role is legitimated by their competency in ritual language styles, knowledge of cosmology, and presumed access to supernatural sources of power. Beyond this, specialists resist categorization. Some deprecate their expertise or even deny that they are specialists. 

""Their humility notwithstanding, basir are the most cosmologically sophisticated adherents of Hindu Kaharingan, though they are not the sole type of ritual specialist (Schiller 1989, Jay 1993) … Recitations of chants in the context of ritual are known as balian … Chants are led by the most skilled specialist, the basir upu or upu balian, who sings in exquisite metaphors charting journeys through other realms of existence. The remaining specialists respond in unison, and all
accompany the chants on their drums. Expertise can be determined by where each specialist sits in relation to the head basir, who sits at the center of the bench. Basir positioned to the immediate right or left of the basir upu are referred to as pangapit sambil and pangapit gantau, respectively. Basir seated at the ends of the bench farthest from the upu are the lawin katil … [42] … Today any villager so inclined may apprentice to become a basir. Unless that person acquires the requisite level of skill to serve as head specialist, no public initiation marks achievement of proficiency. Before a specialist may officiate at a balian for the first time, however, he or she must hold a  ceremony to establish a ‘bridge’ to other cosmological realms for use throughout his or her career. An exception are basir who have inherited the use of such a bridge from a deceased relative. Individuals who participate in balian irregularly or who have achieved only rudimentary skill often say that they can ‘join a balian’ rather than that they ‘are basir.’"" (Schiller, 1997, pp. 40-42)

'The sacred service' (Scharer, 1963, pp. 131-141)

The largest ceremonies at which basir and balian officiated were organized and performed by the inhabitants of particular villages. In theory they were for the welfare of the whole Ngaju 'tribe', all of whom were invited to attend, but in practice only people from neighbouring villages attended:

“One's own world is the central point of all worlds, the focus of the whole divine cosmic order and harmony. This applies also to the village, which after the collapse of the tribal organisation has taken over everything that we said above about the sacred land. The village also represents the social and cosmic totality; the village also possesses the dual division. The upper part of the village (i.e. the upstream, ngaju, part) is lived in by the superior group, and the lower part (ngawa) belongs to the lower group and to the slaves (if any). Villages above and below the village, with which one's own forms a social and religious unity, are classified in the same way. These villages are not only represented at the great purificatory sacrifice, but the blood with which the whole world is cleansed is itself sent to these villages, where it is used to complete the total purification of village, river, fields, men, animals, fruit trees, and so on."" (Scharer, 1963, p. 65)

""When the Watersnake emerges and Mahatala leans down to conduct the sacred service, the total community prepares to take part in the sacred ceremonies and to celebrate in common. The words 'total community' here require some explanation. We may take it for granted that formerly the whole tribe gathered for the great religious/cosmic [138] ceremonies - or, more probably, that it took part in the persons of its most important representatives - for the feast served to renew the world. The world (kalunen) means the area inhabited by the entire tribe, and at the same time mankind, i.e. likewise the whole tribe. Kalunen means the tribal area as well as the tribe. The tribe was divided into two halves which were associated respectively with the Upperworld and the Underworld. These moieties also bore the names of the two rnanifestations of the supreme deities, viz. tambon, Watersnake, and bungai, Hornbill. This tribal organisation has long disintegrated. Only neighbouring villages take part in sacred ceremonies today. They make their appearance as two ri·tual groups called tambon (Watersrmke) and bungai (Hombill). They act as a unity, and in their common aotivity they are called tambon haruei bungai, watersnakes
which are simultaneously hornbills ... It is reasonable
to suppose that they represent the social, religious aJOd cosmic whole, and that they appear as the total godhead whose name they bear and whose emblems (sacred spear and cloth) they bring for the performance of the sacred service. There is also good reason to believe that these ritual groups represent the whole society and assume the former funations of the entire tribe, for in the priestly chants it is not only neighbouring villages which are summoned to take part in the feast, but the invitation is extended to the whole of the former tribal area ... In reality, however, only the neighbouring villages come.

""Before the sacred service begins, the elder charged with the organisation and conduct of the ceremony calls the people of the neighbouring villages to take part. They set out in richly decorated boats, flags flying. Gifts intended as comri'butions to the feast (rice, beer, coconuts, sacred jars, gongs, sacrificial animals and posts, and formerly slaves for sacrifice as well) are sent in separate boats ... [139] ... The delivery of these presents and their presentation are carried out in a ritual fashion ... If a religious/cosmic feast is held later in
the village of the guests, then the members of the village which they now visit are obliged to take part in it and to bring the same gifts. There is thus a periodic reciprocal exchange of goods. The guests do not come alone, but bring their divine ancestors and their dead with them. Some of the participants wear masks. These represent the ancestors and the dead ... The whole community of the living and the dead thus takes part in the sacred service, and animals and plants also appear in the shape of masks."" (Scharer, 1963, pp 137-138). 

However, according to Miles (1970), ceremonies were held at the household level only, though they were believed to benefit the whole village. Nothing is said about representatives from neighbouring villages being invited. Also, Miles says nothing about judges, though does refer to 'fines' and 'punishments'. 

""The ceremonial unit and the local group are coterminous. Every ritual enforces a sense of community on otherwise self-sufficient households and overrides differences between them."" (Miles, 1970. p. 317)","scharer1963[39-97, 131-141];schiller1997[39-42];miles1970"

""Tribal groups (butubutu) in Roviana are headed by chiefs (bangara) and at the village level, elders (palabatu), who exercise control over access to land and sea resources within ancestral estates (pepeso). Conceptually these estates consist of property domains extending from the mountains of the New Georgia mainland down to the barrier islands and out to sea, ending halfway to Rendova (Aswani 1997:143). As a central place, Nusa Roviana is a grounded axis marking some of the more important territorial divisions. The island is divided into three major districts … The outer seaward coast is Vuragare and is historically associated with the near coast of Rendova and the barrier islands lying on the reef heading west. The inner lagoon side of the island is Kalikoqu, and has given its name to one of Roviana’s largest tribal areas, encompassing the lagoon and coastal mainland up to the barrier reef village of Baraulu. The northwest promontory of Nusa Roviana is named Kokorapa, and is associated with territory on the mainland opposite and towards Munda. Kokorapa is the site of the present day village, which itself is further divided into hamlets composed of descendants of different ancestors. Likewise, Vuragare and Kalikoqu are also further divided into sections corresponding to the sites of hamlets, mostly now abandoned."" (Thomas, 2003, p. 58)

Overview of leadership:

""Following Keesing (1985), Roviana leadership can be thought of in terms of three dimensions of control: ability in managing a ritual sphere of communication with ancestral spirits; demonstration of power through violence; and ability in social management and wealth accumulation, Keesing argues that in Malaita, these elements were idealised types of paths leaders might fit or follow – a successful person could become a priest, a warrior, or an entrepreneur depending on their natural disposition and persona choice … The Roviana case seems similarly to revolve around these dimensions, with established positions of hiama (priest), tie varane (warrior), palabatu (village heads or elders) and bangara. However, heredity seems to have been the guiding principle in determining  which persons were actually eligible for leadership status … So far, I have used the term ‘bangara’ as equivalent to ‘chief’ and this is how it is glossed in Pijin. But, in relation to the ‘big man/chief’ opposition of earlier anthropology, the translation does not sit well. It is clear that bangara status was not realized according to strict rules, but instead could arise through various combinations of achievement, personality, and inheritance … the title itself applied to the ceremonially installed (vabangaria) head of a butubutu, and so had some genealogical basis … Appointment was ideally based on formal selection from close descendants of ancestral bangara or nomination by a predecessor before death. However, actual public acceptance of bangara status was decided by the community’s judgement of an appointee’s performance [104] and character. (Thomas, 2003, pp. 103-104)

Role of the bangara:

""The ‘boys’ referred to here are the retinue of followers a bangara could expect to lend aid during headhunting raids and attendant practices. But this can be extended to all members of the butubutu able to help in communal enterprises such as building, or gardening … Hocart’s informants held that an ideal bangara was ‘strong – they possessed enough shell valuables to support bonito fishing, head-hunting raids and frequent large feasts; they controlled garden lands, pigs and Canarium but trees; and some held ritual knowledge of spells … For the community as a whole, such a bangara was the moral epitome of benevolence, generosity and strength – they promoted peace and prosperity (White 1991:10-2) … It was the bangara who negotiated the sacrifices, punishments and compensation payments (hinere) necessary when community members committed adultery or murder. As with opposite-sex siblings there was a supernatural bond between the behaviour of commoners and the fortune of the bangara – unpunished adultery led the sickness or death of the bangara, and murder resulted in the extinction of a family or decimation of the district by tomate ta sekena or boso lau (spirits of murder victims) … The latent violence derived, in part, from the role of bangara as sponsors of headhunting expeditions (qeto). As noted above, success in headhunting was a material proof of having [107] been blessed by ancestral mana – bangara, as descendant representatives of the ancestors, were the managers of these practices and recipients of blessings (which by extension transferred to their followers within the butubutu). Consequently, headhunting can be thought of as a form of ancestor veneration that was both dependent on bangara and enhanced their authority to rule.

""It was the sole responsibility of bangara to decide when to confuct a raid, usually on specific occasions of inauguration or transition for which enemy heads were ceremonially required. Such occasions included the inauguration of skull shrines, communal houses (paele), ritual structures (zelepade), and tomoko [war canoes]; the death of a bangara; and the release the mourning widow of a bangara from confinement (Hocart, 1931: 303)."" (Thomas, 2005, pp. 106-107)

Bangara and priests:

""The role of hiama in Roviana included tending shrines and conducting ceremonial rites – they would burn offerings, handle crania and shell valuables, and ritually communicate with tomate … Most accounts of hiama come from Simbo and seldom mention whether the position could ever be inherited – in Roviana the case is a little clearer. Genealogical information suggests that at one time bangara and hiama duties were conducted by the same person. Schneider (1996: 223) argues that a separation into different offices soccurred shortly after the rule of Qorabele, with the brothers Hiqebangara and Hipobangara becoming hiama and bangara respectively … From this point onwards the genealogical data show that hiama status was transferred to descent group members. But this relatives primarily to a kind of ‘paramount hiama’ – the principal ritual specialists of the Roviana polity (ngati hiama) – rather than persons selected by minor hamlets for the tending of specific shrines, or upon specific occasions."" (Thomas, 2005, p. 112)

More on high priests:

""Butubutu members had rights to access emata – tracts of land that had been cultivated by previous generations, where family gardens (inuma) could be established … The role of ngati hiama was to conduct ceremonies at garden shrines to supplicate tamasa and hence ensure that the earth within emata was fertile – particularly at times when people felt that crops were not growing well, because, having been neglected, the tamasa were ‘cool’ (sa lomoso na tamasa). Hocart (1922: 284-9) describes a round of fertility ceremonies on Simbo whereby hiama visited various tamasa shrines … [249] … As noted above, similar ceremonies occurred in Roviana at various local hope mangini (the name is significant, metaphorically indicating the shrine’s purpose in making the tamasa and soil ‘hot’ (mangini) again). Often such fertility rites would be conducted by minor hiama at shrines on emata used by local family groups, but for matters that concerned all Kazukuru land the ngati hiama held ceremonies at a central, apical garden shrine, which in Riabule’s time was at Vatada, Munda … The ngati hiama acted in these ceremonies of fertility and clearance as a mediator (tie varikarovae), using an inherited ability to enjoin a response from tamasa for the well-being of the community."" (Thomas, 2005, pp. 248-249)

""According to the above, we can think of minor hiama … as ‘children’ of the ngati hiama … or rather, as genealogically conceived elements of their distributed personhood … A ngati hiama was revealed as such only during moments of encompassment, during ceremonies at the central shrine when he acted as an overarching ‘one’ on helaf, and with the force, of ‘many’: the many ancestral ngati hiama, and the many [252] minor hiama distributed with local garden shrines throughout the lands of the butubutu (not to mention the wider community invested in the ceremonies."" (Thomas, 2005, pp. 251-252)

More on the religious role of the bangara:

""On Nusa Roviana, authority was not demonstrated so much in an ordered control over place (though this was no doubt a factor), but in an ability to commune effectively with power-giving ancestors. Chiefly personhood became reliant on the demonstration of ancestral blessing evinced through effective practice rather than on the demonstration of territorial control and ownership of land."" (Thomas, 2005, p. 91)

19818,kodi,85,0,151-0,"'The Kodi construction of the past' (Hoskins, 1997, pp. 29-169)

Kodi consists of a number of 'ancestral villages':

“These forty possessions are distributed among thirty-one ancestral villages, out of the total of sixty-six villages found in Kodi.” (Hoskins, 1997, p. 120)

Prior to the arrival of the Dutch, politics in Kodi and other parts of western Sumba is described as being a 'big man' system rather than one with centralized rule:

“Sumba at the beginning of the twentieth century was divided into about twenty indigenous domains. Those in the eastern part of the island were ruled by a single lord, usually [176] addressed as tamu umbu, who was the head of stratified, autocratic polity. In the western domains, no such centralized ruler existed; instead one found a shifting, achievement-oriented competition between ‘big men’ who established their power bases from ancestral villages but did not rule over their fellows.” (Hoskins, 1997, pp. 175-176)

""Since there was no Kodi 'king' before the colonial period, Horo's references to insults inflicted on the 'sacred power of traditional rulers' ... borrow an idiom of divine kingship that applied to other parts of Indonesia, but not to precolonial West Sumba. Despite its linguistic and ceremonial definition as a domain, Kodi's constitution as an independent polity was as imaginary as those historical fictions that first linked Indonesians into a single national community."" (Hoskins, 1997, p. 319)

There were 'priests', who appear to have solely religious functions, as well as leaders called rato katoda, who led headhunting raids against non-Kodi. Little detail is provided about the role of the rato katoda, but given the denial of centralized political authority in the excepts above, it seems likely that this role was temporary and/or informal.

“In Kodi, the polarity was established between the passive ritual authority of the rato marapu, the priest whose seclusion within the village protected the crops and the [56] rhythm of the seasons, and the rato katoda, the war leader who used his magical powers to raid neighboring peoples and appropriate their vitality for his own people. The competition for life and political power was played out between domains through the taking of heads and the capture of prisoners. The power of the Sea Worm Priest was centrifugal: it spiraled outward from him, the unmoving center that held together the round of seasons and agricultural activities. The power of the headhunting leader, by contrast, was centripetal: it turned inward to the center, bringing the trophy heads back into the domain and placing their fertile, vital energies at the disposition of the victors.” (Hoskins, 1997, pp. 55-56)

In 1909, 'elders' from all the ancestral villages of Kodi met to choose a leader (raja or toko) at the request of the Dutch:

""In 1909, when the Dutch took effective control of the island of Sumba, they asked the people of Kodi to choose a leader to serve as an administrator and representative to the colonial powers. This leader would be presented with the gold staff that created the colonial office of raja, the native administrator of each ‘self-governing region.’ A meeting of elders from all the ancestral villages was held in Tossi, in the Council House established by Rato Pokilo, and they agreed to choose this leader from the home of the urn, the most sacred object in the domain. Hence Rato Loghe Kanduyo, [128] a famous orator and warrior descended from Rato Pokilo, was selected to be the first raja, serving as a spokesman and mediator vis-à-vis outside forces. 

“His selection was legitimated by an argument involving the genders of the urn and the staff and the idea of complementarity … The male staff served as the ‘husband’ of the female urn. This symbolic marriage linked the two offices, making the representative of the Dutch colonial administration into the junior partner in a division of powers, since the holder of the staff (called the toko, the native term for raja, from the Indonesian tongkat) owed ritual deference to his senior, the priest of the sea worms.” (Hoskins, 1993, pp. 127-128)

The power and legitimacy of the rajas increased after the first rebelled against the Dutch:

""As an officer of the Netherlands East Indies government, the new raja was supposed to explain its civilizing mission to his people as well as provide labor for bridge- and road-building projects to improve communications. Two years later, in 1911, rumors circulated that Dutch soldiers had enslaved noblemen to work on these projects, insulted the raja, and raped a local woman. An armed rebellion began with the ambush and killing of four soldiers by headhunters from outlying villages, who fled 
into the forest with the guns captured from the soldiers. The  Dutch forces retaliated by burning the raja's village of Tossi, after which they took refuge with his rivals in another river valley.

""To avenge the burning of his village, the raja gave permission for military attacks to continue. He took the traditional symbols of governmental power-the urn and plate-off into the bush and hid them. Yet he did bring the Dutch staff of office with him when he rode, in a procession bringing gold and livestock, to meet the Dutch commander and negotiate a peace payment. Instead of talking to him, however, the commander pulled him from his horse, bound him under the house, and made him 
march to a distant prison, where he soon died. This brutal punishment of the first native ruler united almost all the population in opposition to the Dutch presence. Three years of fighting followed, with rebel forces hiding [129] in the interior and attacking the colonial army periodically. The Dutch, deciding to starve out their enemies, then forced everyone to move to coastal villages and leave their gardens behind. Finally, pressured by famine and hardship, the rebel forces surrendered and were sent into exile. 

""This first sequence of events shows the consequences of differences between local understandings of governmental power and those of the Dutch colonial forces. The Dutch expected to find rulers who could command the population and thus concentrated power and wealth in the man chosen as raja. By contrast, Kodi perceived the raja, at least initially, as a mediator and spokesman, who would speak for them in negotiations with outside forces but who had no authority to act without a meeting of elders from each village.

""The creation of a Kodi polity, and after that of a regional resistance movement, was one of the unintended consequences of the colonial encounter. Because no single ruler preceded them, the Dutch had to establish the legitimacy of the first Kodi raja themselves. Rato Loghe Kanduyo died in the process of his transformation into a raja, and his nephew Ndera Wulla made the first claims to a new and different form of political power ..."" (Hoskins, 1993, pp. 128-129)

With Indonesian independence, the office of raja was reduced to a merely ceremonial one:

“After independence, traditional rulers were left in ceremonial positions and respected, but virtually all power was taken from them: a new nationalist rhetoric asserted that because all of Indonesia was once a ‘village democracy,’ past hierarchies and inequalities were the creation of a ‘feudal’ colonial system and should be abolished."" (Hoskins, 1997, p. 132)

Kodi retained its status as an administrative unit but appears to have been fully incorporated into the Indonesian political system. The camat ('district head') could be Kodi (Hoskins, 1993, p. 164), but there seems to have been no requirement for this.",hoskins1997[29-169]

“The island was formerly sharply divided up into five districts, Noatau to the east, Faguta to the south, ltoteu to the west, and to the north Malaha and Oinafa ... Later Itoinotu (the part cut off) was separated from Itoteu, leaving a part to the west still belonging to Itoteu, but completely separated from it by the new district ... Faguta was divided into two districts, Pepji and Juju, by the other districts after a successful war, to weaken the power of its chief ... [429] ...The districts were subdivided into hoag, a name applied to all the houses of a family, which were placed together, forming, if the family was a large one, a small village; it is also applied to the family itself.” (Gardiner, 1898a, pp. 428-429)

‘The sou and his officers’ (Gardiner, 1898b, pp. 460-466)

“The head chief of the island, or fakpure, was also one of the officers of a spiritual chief, who was termed the sou, but who really had little to do with the government of the island, and  who lived wherever he was placed by the fakpure and the other chiefs. The position seems to have been directly comparable to that of the how of Tonga, but, while the latter had considerable tem-poral power, the sou had none... [461] ... The sou had as attendants a number of officers whose duty it [462] was to protect him, at the risk of their own lives, even if he was fighting with their own districts; they were drawn out of all the districts and supposed to be representative men of each ... Their names or titles were in order of precedence mua (chief priest), hagnata, titopu, fakpure (head chief), fanhoga (wife to sou), fahoa, fagata, tonhida (messenger), and mafuida (the presiding officer over all feasts) ... The duty of the sou was simply to see after the proper  performance of the various feasts, all of which had some religious rites. He was however in no way under the priests, of the different atua ... nor does he seem to have had any connection with them. It was his business to preside over the feasts, and, whatever might be desired, he had to pray for at the same time as he poured out the kava to the god."" (Gardiner, 1898b, pp. 460-462)

Smaller-scale religious offices:

""The 'hoag gods' were usually incarnated in the form of some animal, as the tanifa (the hammer-headed shark), juli (sand-piper), olusi (lizard), mafrop (gecko), etc. Should a man by any chance have happened to kill one of the particular animal which was his atua, he would have had to make a big feast, cut all his hair off and bury it, just in the same way as a man  would be buried. Other animals, other than their own particular one, could be killed as they liked, as only their own atua in this class had power over them. To take the tanifa, the god of Maftau: for him there was a priest, termed an apoiitu, who officiated on all great occasions, and a priestess, called by the  same name, whose business it was to cure sicknesses, and, [468] indeed, to see to all minor troubles ... Should Maftau be in trouble or be going to war, a big feast would be held, and the best of everything would be placed in the sea for the tanifa: a root of kava, a pig, taro, yams, etc., and always a cocoanut leaf. Much, too, would be given to the apioiitu, but always uncooked ...… The priestess was, on the other hand, really more a doctress, called in by the present of a pig and a mat … he would get inito a frenizy, and so drive the devil which was troubling the person away. At the same time she never failed to give them herbs and other remedies. These offices were held by families, and their mysteries, such as they were, passed on from parent to child.” (Gardiner, 1898b, pp. 467-468)",gardiner-1898a;gardiner-1898b

This ‘power’ was associated primarily with the ancestors, the grande case, and the chief. The chief was a nonautocratic ‘older brother,’ who mediated between the world of the living and the parallel world of the dead. His effective power was limited by the council of elders, who controlled the succession (a role that the colonial government would try to usurp) and by the clan’s uterine relations. In general, the small-scale political structure of the clan in New Caledonia was egalitarian and minimally hierarchical … Although a number of clans in a given area could be united by a larger and looser ‘tribal’ organization presided over by a grand chef, the principal ties were still ones of dialect and kinship. These groups, varying considerably in size and coherence, lived in semipermanent hostility, a state of ‘war’ tempered by custom and alliance. The colonial hegemony reduced, but did not eliminate, such rivalries.” (Clifford, 1982, p 41)",clifford1982[41]

The only 'authorities' within Casiguran Dumagat society were 'presidentes' appointed by the government, of which there was one in each 'settlements'. However, many of the Casiguran Dumagats did not live in these settlements and hence were not under administrative control:

“Whatever I have said in my former reports about the economical, social and political life of the Negritos, might be repeated here. The only authorities among them are the ‘presidentes’, one in each settlement, who have been appointed by and receive a salary from the Director of the so-called non-Christian tribes. Negritos under the latter's jurisdiction have been gathered in some kind of settlements, but these are easily abandoned, notwithstanding Government interference and the help that is extended to the Negritos in building a better class of huts.” (Vanoverbergh, 1938, p. 149)

Although the role of 'presidente' was obviously an imposed one, many Casiguran Dumagats appear to have greatly respected their presidentes (though perhaps for their personal qualities rather than because of their office):

“Mr. Custodio repeatedly told me that the Negrito school at Calabgan would never thrive, because it was in the immediate proximity of the Constabulary barracks, and the Negritos did not want their grown-up daughters to be at the mercy of the soldiers, who frequently abused them. He also said that, whenever their president was absent, the remaining Negritos asked him to be allowed to leave the settlement. Incidentally this goes to show that the [139] Government has done wisely in appointing Mulan president of the Calabgan Negritos. His influence among them is undeniable, and this is due to the fact that he is not afraid to state his case before anybody, even before higher Government.” (Vanoverbergh, 1938, pp. 138-139)

Headland states in the Encyclopaedia of World Cultures that the Agta (including the Casiguran Dumagat) have 'no chiefs or formal leaders of any kind beyond the nuclear household':

""Like other hunter-gatherer societies, Agta political organization
is weak. There are no chiefs or formal group leaders of
any kind beyond the nuclear household. Organized social life
is controlled primarily by the nuclear family heads (i.e., the
father and mother). Women participate equally with their
husbands in decision making. Secondarily, social organization
is based on the personal kindred. Social control is therefore
quite weak. Individuals tend to do what they wish. If
individuals go against the norms of the camp, or manifest disruptive deviant behavior, they will first be put in their place
through oblique criticism, and then by ostracism. If that does
not work, families will just move away. There are no laws or
fines for keeping people in line, except ostracism. Conflicts
are usually resolved by one of the families moving away and,
in fact, moving is the primary mechanism for resolving interpersonal problems between families."" (Headland, 1993, p. 6)",vanoverbergh1937;headland1993[6]

‘The divine order’ (Scharer, 1963, pp. 39-97)

‘Divine justice’ (Scharer, 1963, pp. 98-119)

To the extent that political authority existed in Ngaju society, it appears to have been vested in groups rather than individuals. According to Scharer leaders were chosen from the 'superior' group. Specific leaders that Scharer mentions are 'adat-chiefs' (demang or kepala adat), 'judges', village elders (bakas lewu), and  'village heads' (pambakal). Of these, only judges are described in detail. Scharer notes that the role of 'adat-chief' was seen as a colonial imposition and was not particularly respected by the Ngaju. Nothing is said about military leaders beyond noting that they came from the 'superior group'. The position of 'judge' appears to have been a temporary one - a panel of judges (bakas basara), one of which was appointed 'president' (mantir basara) was assembled when a particularly important legal case (basara) needed to be heard (more routine cases were dealt with by the bakas lewu and the pambakal). Judges appear to have acted on behalf of individual villages, but were often recruited from other villages within the same 'neighbourhood':

""The superior group also possesses the position of leadership in the society. From it are selected the judges, military leaders, and the kepala adat, i.e. the adat-chiefs who see that the hadat is followed. (Schärer, 1946, p 41)

""The present-day damang (adat-chief), in whose election the Government has the casting vote, has nothing in common with the traditional position of judge ... It is thus understandable that the attitude of the people towards this governmental post should be passive and indifferent."" (Schärer, 1946, pp 102-103)

""A distinction is made between minor and major law cases (basara korik and basara hat). The minor type of case is heard by the leaders of the village, i.e. the village headman (pambakal) and the village elders (bakas lewu). They only decide minor cases of offences against hadat, which do not bring disaster on the entire community. A case of this kind can nevertheless be regarded as an action by the whole community to the extent that each village represents totality. A minor case is not heard in the balai, the assembly-house, but in the house of the headman or of one of the village elders."" (Schärer, 1946, p 103)

""If the village elders are unable to settle a feud, because the parties are not satisfied with the verdict, or if a severe offence against hadat has to be judged, the case is handed over to a consort of judges assembled from the village headmen and most respected elders of the surrounding neighborhood. This consortium, which is newly selected for each case, is called together for a session which is to be held in one of their own villages … On the day, those who have been invited come in from the surrounding villages and take their places in the balai. They are greeted there by the headman and the village elders, and after a meal the initial formalities are concluded and the trial, which must likewise be held in the balai, begins … The assembly of judges (bakas basara) select a president (mantir basara) from among themselves. Usually the choice falls on the most respected of the men gathered there. He is the representative of the godhead, which appears in him as avenger, judge and restorer of order. His function is to listen silently to how the assembly conducts the case, expressing his own view only in case of strong difference of opinion, and finally, when the case has been heard, to pronounce the verdict."" (Schärer, 1946, pp 104-105)

By contrast, Miles (1970) does not mention any of these officials,or any formal leadership roles at all. In fact, Miles describes Ngaju society as consisting of largely autonomous households:

“The ceremonial unit and the local group are coterminous. Every ritual enforces a sense of community on otherwise self-sufficient households and overrides differences between them.” (Miles, 1970, p. 317)

It may be noted that Miles' 'Ngadju' are a broader group than Scharer's 'Ngaju', which could account for some of the discrepancies. 

“The word Ngadju refers to the inhabitants of upstream communities along those Borneo rivers that flow into the Java Sea … [292] … Until recently, there was much inconsistency in the terminology of ethnographic accounts about southern Borneo. Hardeland’s 1859 dictionary (Daiaksch-Deutsches Wörterbuch) calls the hinterland population of the area Dayak, but the vocabulary he includes is that of people on the Kahayan River only. Later, German and Swiss missionaries (e.g. Epple 1933) referred to the language as Ngadju. In this usage, residents of other southern river systems were excluded from the Ngadju category.

“In fact, Ngadju means ‘upstream’; and native speakers employ the word in a strictly local sense which embraces all Dayaks anywhere in Borneo’s interior. Mallinckrodt (1924-25) partially follows the vernacular, but in order to distinguish southern-river Dayaks from others, he restricts the term to people living on rivers flowing south from the Schwaner and Muller mountain ranges. He thereby categorizes as Ngadju, the Dayaks on the Katingan, Mentaya, Kahayan, Kapuas, and Barito and excludes the Maanyaan and Siang on rivers flowing west from the Meratus into the Barito mainstream. Hudson and Hudson (1967) appear to regard these last two entities as separate from the Ngadju, rather than a subcategory. Geddes (n.d.) does the opposite and follows Kennedy (1962). I feel that the latter practice will remain the most justifiable one until the linguistic and cultural distribution map is complete."" (Miles, 1970, p. 91)",scharer1963[39-119];miles1970

""Government of Tikopia through the coajoint powers of the chiefs raises the question of the jurisdiction which each of them exercised. The basis of the Tikopia political system lay in the chief as head and representative of his clan. Every person in Tikopia as a member of a clan acknowledged obedience to his own chief. But the jurisdiction of each chief was not simply restricted to a clan alignment. It also operated on a local basis, although this was less clearly defined. Each chief lived in a separate village and in that village exercised great authority. Moreover, his authority also extended throughout the whole district – or side of the island – in which he regularly lived. For social purposes the jurisdiction of the chiefs was closely related to this district division. In particular, the single authority of the Ariki Tafua in the district of Faea contrasted with the treble authority of the other chiefs who together held sway over the district of Ravenga and its subsidiary Namo. These political relations of the chiefs were very important in general district rivalry and intra-district co-operation.

""But the jurisdiction of a Tikopia chief was not only in district terms any more than in purely clan terms. Every person in Tikopia acknowledged obedience to any chief in a situation with which both were immediately concerned. A chief could claim by general status much of which he was debarred from claiming by the lack of clan right. In other words, there was a notion of a general order in Tikopia in which a chief, by virtue of his office, had jurisdiction in respect of the whole society.""

19232,ngaju,85,2,151-2,"‘The divine order’ (Scharer, 1963, pp. 39-97)

Scharer describes Ngaju society as consisting of five subgroups: the 'superior group', the 'inferior or poor group', the 'slaves', the 'witch group', and the 'priestly group'.

Political leadership was vested in the 'superior group'. Political leaders do not appear to have had direct dealings with the supernatural (this was the province of the 'priestly group'), but played a religious role insofar as they enforced the divinely sanctioned order 'hadat':

""The superior group also possesses the position of leadership in the society. From it are selected the judges, military leaders, and the kepala adat, i.e. the adat-chiefs who see that the hadat is followed."" (Scharer, 1963, p. 41)

""The Dayak has his own laws and norms, derived from the primeval sacred events and explainable only in relation to these, which we shall call commandments of the creation because they were given at the time of the creation. The word which we translate by this term is hadat, and in it we are concerned with the conception of God and with the primeval sacred events ..."" (Scharer, 1963, p. 74)

The 'priestly group' differed from the other four categories in that it was clearly an occupational category rather than a hereditary stratum. The membership of this group was mostly drawn from the slaves, and were both despised and respected:

""The most interesting group, sociologically and religiously, in the society is that of the balian and basir, priestesses and priests … On the basis of various reports, which for the most part agree fairly well with each other, we can construct the following account of the position of the balian and basir in Ngaju public life. Young and beautiful slave-girls were designated balian by the freemen (higher and lower groups). Over a period of years they were instructed in the sacred chants, legends, and rites by an older and experienced balian. They remained slaves in the possession of their owners, but they no longer worked in the fields, and took part to only a slight degree in household tasks. The profit which they brought to their masters lay in the fact that they were hired out as prostitutes, singers, and dancers, and also as priestesses at feasts and on other occasions … [54] … Formerly (and still today) daughters of freemen occasionally became balian. The cause of this extremely unusual step is usually that they have been seduced into it or a disappointment in love … Hardeland states in his dictionary that it is felt to be a shameful thing if a relative (he has in mind the freemen) becomes a balian.""  (Schärer, 1963, pp. 53-54)

“On the one hand, the regard in which the balian are held in society is high. They are necessary, they are employed in every fashion, and they are favoured by the law in every respect. Offences against them are punished doubly (Hardeland, dictionary). On the other hand, though, it is felt to be shameful if a daughter or relative becomes a balian … The balian and basir act as mediators between men and gods and also between the two mythical groups of Maharaja Sangiang and Maharaja Buno into which the entire community is divided on the occasion of every major religious ceremony, but they really belong to neither of these groups. They have their own village of the dead in the Upperworld.” (Scharer, 1963, p. 56)

“The position of the basir in the community agrees generally with that of the balian … [57] … The basir are composed of hermaphrodites and impotent men. They are popularly regarded exactly as are the balian: on the one hand they are honoured, on the other despised, and it is regarded as similarly shameful if a son or relative becomes a basir.” (Scharer, 1963, pp. 56-57)

It may be noted that Miles (1970) provides a very different account of Ngaju society that does not mention social classes, judges, or village headmen, and in fact suggests that religious ceremonies may have been the only activities that involved the whole community.

“The ceremonial unit and the local group are coterminous. Every ritual enforces a sense of community on otherwise self-sufficient households and overrides differences between them.” (Miles, 1970, p. 317)",scharer1963[39-97];miles1970

18916,lifou,85,3,151-3,"'Lifou' (Guiart, 1963, pp. 351-545)

There were three chiefdoms on Lifou: Weṭ, Gaiča, and Lösi. 

'Weṭ' (Guiart, 1963, pp. 352-455)

The high chieftainship of Weṭ belonged to a kin group called Wenedhia. The Wenedhia had originally installed as the chiefs by groups called the Atesi and the Haeta, who still had special privileges:

« La grand chef actuel, Pascal Sihaze, écrivait à notre usage:

« ‹ La famille actuelle du grand chef de Weṭ sort de la souche de Wenedhia, du clan, Gala. Ce sont les Atesi et les Haeta qui ont élu primitivement Wenedhia au trône de la chefferie de Hnupel. Une cérémonie coutumière commémore cet événement, encore de nos jours, par le champ d’ignames de Keny que le grand chef doit cultivar pour en donner la récolte aux Atesi et aux Haeta.›

« Cette version, simple et vraisemblable, se présente comme l’expression d’une verité officiell. Nombreux sont les informateurs qui, de manière plus ou moins hardie, plus ou moins precise, désirent y apporter des complements, si ce n’est que par allusions. » (Guiart, 1956, p. 352)

(""The current high chief, Pascal Sihaze, wrote for us:

""'The family of the current high chief of Weṭ belong to the stock of Wenedhia, of the clan Gala. It was the Atesi and Haeta who first elected Wenedhia to the throne of the chiefdom of Hnupel. A customary ceremony commemorates this event, even today, by the yam field of Keny which the high chief must cultivate to give the harvest to the Atesi and Haeta.'

""This version, simple and plausible, is presented as the expression of an official truth. There were many informants who, more or less boldy, more or less precisely, wished to add to it, if only by allusions."")

The high chieftainship of Wenedhia appears to have been mostly nominal. Secular authority largely appears to have been shared by various officials within the wider Gala clan to which Wenedhia belonged:

« Les ‹ sujets › du grand chef Ukeinesö sont les gens dit Angete Gala, membres du même clan, dont le premier chef connu, Wenedhia, fut intronisé grand chef de Weṭ. WAḌAWA DHOXU, chef de la branche des Api Wathodhè, est considéré comme le chef du clan (tixei angete Gala), second en autorité à nul autre qu’Ukeneisö lui- même.

« C’est lui qui ordonne les travaux à l’intérieur de la chefferie. Il peut délégeur cette fonction, mais seulement à titre temporare, à Hno, chef de la branche de Gala dite des Api Gwiet, ou à Čo, chef des Api Ḍawan.

« HWENEGEI, de Čiole (Kirinata), autre personage Api Gẅiet, est le hwat e Gala: il parle pour le grand chef quand celui-ci reçoit le hwémék, le don de bienvenue présénté par un autre grand chef en visite; si le grand chef se déplace, il l’accompagne afin de parler au nom de tous les Angete Gala; cette function fait qu’il ne doit pas le hoṭ à son chef de clan, mais donne une offrande, dite xeninehlapa, au grand chef pour le [361] terrain de Geigei, oú ce dernier envoya résider ses ancêtres ... HNO, chef des Api Gẅiet, est plus particulièrement le chef de guerre de Wet. Son clan représenterait une branche aînée par rapport à celle même d’Ukeinesö. » (Guiart, 1956, pp. 360-361)

(""The 'subjects' of the great chief Ukeinesö are the people known as Angete Gala, members of the same clan, whose first known chief, Wenedhia, was enthroned great chief of Weṭ. 

""WAḌAWA DHOXU, head of the Api Wathodhè branch, is considered the head of the clan (tixei angete Gala), second in authority to none other than Ukeneisö himself.

""It is he who orders the work inside the chiefdom. He can delegate this function, but only temporarily, to Hno, head of the Gala branch known as the Api Gwiet, or to Čo, head of the Api Ḍawan.

""HWENEGEI, from Čiole (Kirinata), another Api Gẅiet character, is the hwat e Gala: he speaks for the great chief when he receives the hwémék, the gift of welcome presented by another visiting great chief; if the great chief moves, he accompanies him in order to speak on behalf of all the Angete Gala; this function means that he does not owe the ḥoṭ [tribute] to his clan chief, but gives an offering, known as xeninehlapa, to the great chief for the land of Geigei, where the latter sent his ancestors to reside ... HNO, chief des Api Gẅiet, is more particularly the war leader of Wet. His clan represents an elder branch than that of Ukeinesö itself."")

Religious authority was clearly in the hands of the Atesi, who were a group of kin groups that included Hwenegei (mentioned above). However, a group called Waleweny was the most important among the Atesi. The Atesi appear to have enjoyed nominal superiority over the high chief, though in practice their role appears to have been restricted to 'magical protection of the chiefdom':

« Les Anga atesi (ou Angatesi) beneficent, à Wet, d’une prestige et un status aussi mal défini qui’il apparaît important à première vue. Les atesi de Lifou sont un peu <la tarte à la crême> des descriptions fragmentairs publiées jusqu’à present, le role qu’on leur attribute variant, suivant le cas, de sorcier à celui de conseiller suprême détrônent à volonté les grands chefs. Le regretté Medecin-Capitaine Fagot, tout en nous expliquant correctement l’origine du terme atesi (de ate sine ite haze, hommes d’essence divine), a verse dans ce défaut, comme d’ailleurs les rares publications missionaries. Nous avons vu comment le myth accorde, pour les changements politiques, le role principal à Idhez et Wawalahae, sans qu’il soit question de Waleweny et des autres atesi.

« Si l’on tente de serrer le problème de plus près, on s’aperçoit qu’à Waleweny et Hwenegei est attribué le role de protection magique de la chefferie, par l’intermédaire de leurs subjects, maîtres de la terre, qui seuls peuvent prévaloir de la possession de haze, et pour cela sont dits tene haze. Ils pouraient évidement, en théorie, retirer cette protection, ce que qui permettrait aux influences contradictoires de jouer, l’équilibre précaire constituent la chefferie de Wet étant alors rompu. C’est en ce sens seulement qu’on leur attribute le pouvoir de deposer le grand chef. Considérés comme les <pères> du grand chef, ils auraient seuls le droit de lui appliquer des sanctions corporelles. Ce droit, reconnu en principle, paraît, en fait, n’avoir jamais été appliqué.

[374]

« Les atesi ne doivent d’autre hommage au grand chef qu’un present de bonne volonté, ou sithingen. Leur fonction permanente est la surveillance de la chefferie, tant afin d’empêcher toute chose pernicieuse venant de l’extérieur, que pour s’opposer àla volonté du grand chef s’ils sont désaccord avec lui. Les grands chefs successifs, que ce soit au moment de la christianisation ou à celui de la prise de possession, ne se sont jamais heurtés de front aux atesi, mais ont utilisédes moyens obliques, attirant la mission catholique, puis l’administration française, pour arriver à leurs fins et tenter d’assurer une authorité aussi absolute que possible sur leur sujets frondeurs, et convertis au christianisme réformé.
On sait que les principaux atesi sont au nombre de quatre: Waixaca à Easo, Hwenegei à Hanawa, Waleweny à Saint-Paul, Isamato à Nathalo.

« De ces quatres grands, WALEWENY serait le principal. Son nom signifie l’arc-en-ciel. On sait son role de la conversion du Wet. Cette volonté, affirmée il y a un siècle, d’être le leader spirituel de la communauté- comme auparavant il était le chef de tous les tene haze – se pursuit aujourd’hui avec le titulaire actuel de la charge, Hnaxeme, que l’on continue à appeler communément Walewene. Cette homme jeune s’est mis à la tête d’un mouvement à l’intérieur de l’église autochthone, mouvement don’t l’essentiel est la constitution des cercles de jeunes gens, et qui est destine à réveiller la conscience des membres d’églises sur le plan social. » (Guiart, 1963, pp. 373-374)

(""The Anga atesi (or Angatesi) enjoy, in Wet, a prestige and a status so ill-defined that it appears important at first glance. The atesi of Lifou are a bit of the ‘cream pie’ of the fragmentary descriptions published to date, the role attributed to them varying, as the case may be, from sorcerer to that that of supreme adviser, dethroning the great chiefs at will. The late Doctor-Captain Fagot, while correctly explaining the origin of the term atesi (de ate sine ite haze, men of divine essence), made this mistake, as did the rare missionary publications.  We have seen how the myth gives Idhez and Wawalahae the lead in political change, without mentioning Waleweny and the other atesi.

""If we take a closer look at the problem, we see that Waleweny and Hwenegei are assigned the role of magical protection of the chiefdom, through as representatives of their subjects, masters of the land, who alone can prevail over the possession of haze, and for this are called tene haze. They could obviously, in theory, remove this protection, which would allow adverse influences, the precarious balance constituting the chiefdom of Wet then being broken. It is only in this sense that they are given the power to depose the high chief. Considered as the ‘fathers’ of the great chief, they alone have the right to apply bodily sanctions to him. This right, recognized in principle, appears, in fact, never to have been applied.

""The atesi owe the great chief no other homage than a gift of goodwill, or sithingen. Their permanent function is the surveillance of the chiefdom, both in order to prevent any pernicious thing from outside, and to oppose the will of the grand chief if they disagree with him. The successive great chiefs, whether at the time of Christianization or at the time of colonisation, never clashed head-on with the atesi, but used oblique means, attracting the Catholic mission, then the French administration, to achieve their ends and try to ensure an authority as absolute as possible over their rebellious subjects, and converts to reformed Christianity.

""We known that there are four principal atesi: Waixaca at Easo, Hwenegei at Hanawa, Waleweny at Saint-Paul, and Isamato at Nathalo.

""Of these four great ones, WALEWENY is the principal one. His name means rainbow. We know his role in the conversion of Wet. This desire, affirmed a century ago, to be the spiritual leader of the community - as before he was the leader of all the tene haze - continues today with the current holder of the office, Hnaxeme, as the we continue to commonly call Walewene. This young man has put himself at the head of a movement within the autochthonous church, a movement essentially constituted by circles of young people, and which is intended to awaken the conscience of the members. churches on the social level."")

Gaiča (Guiart, 1963, pp. 455-477)

Gaiča, the smallest of the three chiefdoms, also had one or more atesi who seems to have played a religious role, while perhaps also holding some secular power:

« Les récit transcrits ont donné déjà un aperçu de la function d’atesi, telle qu’elle était comprise à Gaiča. Il serait bien difficile, aujourd’hui, de préciser ces éléments ... Mexanang(ē) et Wahminya jouent d’ailleurs à la cour d’Alaxuten, pauvre en dignitaries, à la fois le role d’atesi et celui de sinelapa ... [462] ... MEXANANG(Ē) semble avoir été un personage plus important que Wahminya. Vacillant dans sa foi envers son haze, le thu de Isameč, il tenta l’introduction du dieu Finiwn, venu de Hunēdh, c’est-à-dire d’une dépendance directe de la chefferie Bula; Finiwan était d’ailleurs le haze de Hnamemè, atesi de Bula. Plus tard Mexanang(ē) fut, de la même façon, le responsible de l’introduction du christianisme réformé à Gaiča ... Le texte du pasteur Waṭe montre combine la function de Mexanang(ē) semble avoir été de tenir en tutelle Alaxuten et ses descendants. On conçoit les tensions permanentes produites, au sein de la structure de la chefferie, par cette attitude, même commandée par la tradition. Mexanang(ē) parle pour le chef et commande en son nom aux sinelapa, c’est-à-dire même à Wahminya; du moins sur le plan de la vie interne de la chefferie. » (Guiart, 1963, pp. 461-462)

(“The written accounts have already given an indication of the function of atesi as understood in Gaiča. It would be very difficult, today, to specify these elements … At the court of Alaxuten, poor in dignitaries, Mexanang(ē) and Wahminya play the roles of atesi and also of sinelapa [‘assistant’ or ‘deputy’] ...  MEXANANG(Ē) seems to have been a more important character than Wahminya. Wavering in his faith towards his haze [god], the thu of Isameč, he tried to introduce the god Finiwn, who came from Hunēdh, that is to say from a direct dependence of the Bula chiefdom; Finiwan was also the haze of Hnamemé, atesi of Bula. Later Mexanang(ē) was similarly responsible for bringing reformed Christianity to Gaiča ...  Pastor Waṭe’s text shows how the function of Mexanang(ē) seems to have been to keep Alaxuten and his descendants under guard. We can imagine the permanent tensions that this structure produced within the chiefdom, even though it was ordered by tradition. Mexanang(ē) speaks for the chief and commands in his name as sinelapa, that is, the same as Wahminya; at least in terms of the internal life of the chiefdom."")

'Lösi' (Guiart, 1963, pp. 478-544)

Lösi had three atesi whose function was to 'protect' the district, presumably using magic:

« A cela s’ajoutent les atesi de Lösi, au nombre de trois: ČAEÉ, établi à Hmelèk, HNANEMÉ de Hunēdh et PIYA de Luèngöni. Aucun lien mythique n’apparaîtes réunir, au contraire de ce qui se passe à Weṭ. Effectivement, aucune solidarité visible ne semble s’être établi entre eux. Ils sont les protecteurs attitrés de la chefferie Bula, quant du moins ils ne lui sont pas rebelles. Cette ambivalence historique de leur function est ce qui les rapproche le plus de la situation faite à leurs collègues de Weṭ, les atesi i Ukeinesö. Le plus important de trois serait Čaeé. C’est aussie le plus éloigné geographiquement. Tous trois sont pourtant placés sur les routes menant à Mou, comme afin d’assurer la protection de la grande chefferie. » (Guiart, 1963, p. 540)

(""In addition, the atesi of Lösi number three: ČAEÉ, established at Hmelèk, HNANEMÉ of Hunēdh and PIYA of Luèngöni. No mythical link appears to unite them, unlike in Weṭ. Effectively, there seems to be no solidarity between them. They are the appointed protectors of the Bula chiefdom, at least as long as they do not rebel. The historical ambivalence of their function is what brings them closest to the situation faced by their colleagues at Weṭ, the atesi i Ukeinesö. The most important of the three is Čaeé. This is also the furthest geographically. However, all three are placed on the roads leading to Mou, as if to ensure the protection of the great chiefdom."")

Guiart also mentions two other figures who appear to have performed magico-religious functions for all of Lösi:

« KAČEČE est le garde du corps du grand chef, dont au surplus il assure la protection magique, grâce à son haze Čičiate, le martin-pêcheur. » (Guiart, 1963, p. 539)

(""KAČEČE is the bodyguard of the great chief, who in addition assures magical protection, granted by his haze Čičiate, the kingfisher."")

« Les magiciens de la pluie et du soleil, dits hune, ou tene, ḍay, agissant pour le compte du grand chef et de l’ensemble du district, sont les ANGETE ASE de Hunēdh et les ANGETE HMENU de Xode. » (Guiart, 1963, p. 540)

(""The rain and sun magicians, called hune, or tene, ḍay, acting on behalf of the high chief and the whole district, are the ANGETE ASE of Hunēdh and the ANGETE HMENU of Xode."")

None of these figures appear to have had any secular authority. Unlike in Weṭ, the high chief (described as being at the 'top of the hierarch') appears to have outranked the atesi:

« Au sommet de la hiérachie nous avons donc:

« BULA, descendant de Wahemunemè; c’est l’angaghoxu(e), le grand chef.

« Puis, tout d’abord les dhin, dont le chef est GOP(É) ANGADHOXU(E) dit pour cela tixe i ange čipa; il est la ‹bouche du chef›, celui qui transmet les ordres au peuple; de même que, semble-t-il, l’exécuter des hautes oeuvres et le champion du Lösi à la guerre, role où il avait un partenaire … Hnaxu(e) Viliamo est plus simplement la tête de lignée des ANG API ČO, celle des ANG API KAI était le grand chef lui-même, Henri Bula Čakin(è). » (Guiart, 1963, p. 536)

(""At the top of the hierarchy we have therefore:

""BULA, descendant of Wahemunemè, he is the angaghoxu(e), the high chief.

""Then, starting with the dhin [commoners?] whose chief is GOP(É) ANGADHOXU(E), said to be 'tixe i ange čipa'; 'the mouth of the chief', it is he who transmits orders to the people, as well as, it seems, the initiator of public works and the champion of Lösi in war, a role where he has a partner ... Hnaxu(e) Viliamo is most simply the head of the ANG API ČO lineage, that of ANG API KAI is the high chief himself, Henri Bula Čakin(è).""",guiart-1963[351-545]

‘Leaders and professionals’ (Handy, 1923, pp. 36-39)

Except on Ua Pou, political organization did not extended beyond the 'tribe'. 'Tribes' could have a unitary structure, or could have 'subdivisions', each of which had its own chief. Some tribes with 'subdivisions' also had a chief with authority over the tribe as a whole, whereas in other cases the subdivisions were independent. It is unclear how common each of these arrangements was.

“It has been pointed out that in some of the large valleys there were single great tribes with subdivisions, while in other places there was a number of unrelated tribes; that, beyond certain loose alliances there was no unity between different sections of islands and different valleys, and even that there was warfare within single valleys between related tribes. In other words, political organization in the Marquesas never went beyond the tribal stage.

“Every tribe had its chief. When some of the great tribes were subdivided, the subdivisions had each its own chief, who was entirely independent; in other tribes the chiefs of the subtribes were under the authority of the chief of the larger group ... 
It has already been pointed out that it was only on the island of Ua Pou that there was any approach to political unity on one island through dominance by a single chief: in other words, that this was the only island which had what might properly be called a king. It is my opinion, however, that it is unnecessary to dignify any chief in the Marquesas by the title, 'king,' for the political organization was always of the very simplest order, and the relationship of the haka-iki and his people was always that of a chief to his fellow-tribesmen, never approaching that of a king to subjects."" (Handy, 1923, p. 35)

'Community structures' (Handy, 1923, pp. 42-44)

The settlement pattern in the Marquesas was dispersed. The closest thing to a 'local community' appears to have been the 'tribe' or 'subtribe':

""Dwellings were not concentrated in villages but scattered throughout the length of the valley, or, in a few bays, along the shore. There seems to [43] have been little tendency toward the formation of village communities. Private establishments consisted of a large sleeping house on a stone platform, a cook house near-by, a sacred house for old men, a house for storing food, and in the near vicinity a sacred place. The chief's establishment was the community center. It included his sleeping house, which was larger and more elaborate than most private dwellings and was built on a stone platform; his cook house, storage house, the dwellings of his attendants on stone platforms; a warriors' house, also on a stone platform; a paved dance area, on which were sometimes special houses for canoes, for the preparation of feasts, or the like, with surrounding platforms for spectators, on which were erected temporary structures at the times of rites and festivals; ovens; a temple, which was usually associated with this feast place and with the chief's establishment; and a vai ke'etu, an enclosed, fresh-water basin made of cut, red stone slabs, reserved as the sacred bathing place of the chief's eldest son. In secluded and usually elevated locations there were other sacred places (me'ae), which also belonged to the chief and served for tribal ceremonial and burial."" (Handy, 1923, p. 42)

Based on these descriptions, it seems that supralocal political authority would have existed in the Marquesas on Ua Pou, and also in cases in which a tribe was split into 'subdivisions' but had a single chief. However, Thomas (1990) is emphatic that supralocal political authority only existed on Ua Pou:

""The importance of tau'a is undelrined by the fact that, while evidence for any supralocal authority in the early contact period (except on 'Ua Pou) is lacking, the potency of some tau'a was clearly recognized in more than one valley: that of Tamapuameini was acknowledged over a whole island. There thus seems to have been a crude difference between the renown of certain shamans and that of any chief."" (Thomas, 1990, p 36)

'Administration of tribal affairs' (Handy, 1923, pp. 53-57)

""In communal enterprise, whether work, war, or feasting, the chief nominally determined what should be done and when. The actual planning, organization, and execution were, however, accomplished by the administrative and industrial tuhuna under him. It was explained to me once that the chief knew nothing about the organization of industries, great festivals, and the like, but that his was the wealth which enabled him to employ those who did know. I have evidence, however, which shows that some chiefs, at least, took an active part in directing labor. For work of a less important character than that of organized industries and festivals, the chief summoned workers by blowing his shell trumpet or sending a tuhuna to secure them.""

'Religion and magic' (Erdland, 1914, pp. 230-283)

Religious authority in the Marshall Islands appears to have been diffuse. Chiefs were regarded as sacred (Dobbin, 2011, p. 123), but there is little indication that they played an active role in religious ritual, though the chief did set the date for the pandanus ceremony (Dobbin, 2011, p. 134).

Religious figures called ri-kanan or ki-kanij are the only religious specialists missioned in missionary accounts, but Dobbin also mentions a 'combined magician-sorcerer-soothsayer-master of ceremonies' called the läadökdök:

""In the past there was a figure in the Marshalls who was famous for this divining, the ri-bubu, but early writers Knappe and Erdland told only about a general sort of religious figure called the ri-kanan or ri-kanij, who performed a strange ritual of stretching out prone on the ground and sticking out his tongue in order to absorb the power of the sun (Erdland 1914, 332). For the contemporary Marshalls, the general titles are broken down into specialties:

""Diviner ri-bubu

""Sorcerer ri-anijnij

""Magician ri-ekapal

""Medicine maker ri-uno

""Storyteller ri-bwebwenato

""Certainly the sorcerers, magicians, and medicine makers—people with extraordinary power and connection to the spirit world—were in this sense leaders or specialists in the old religion. According to Erdland, the [126] combined magician-sorcerer-soothsayer-master of ceremonies (läadökdök) stood as the 'third rank' in Marshallese society, below the high and lower ranked chiefs (1914, 343)."" (Dobbin, 2011, pp. 125-126)

In Erdland, it is clear that while läadökdök often organised religious ceremonies they were not religious specialists per se, but rather commoners who were favoured by chiefs and acted as their unofficial advisers:

""A distinguished person, läadökdök (äadök, 'strong, powerful'), is a common subject who has distinguished himself through intellectual ability or outstanding services on land or sea and who as a reward has received more or less extensive lands as estates in fee from a high chief or subchief. Distinction and title are hereditary. It is the duty of such a ditinguished person, whose position is comparable to that of our middle-class citizen, to help the chief in every way. Although the chiefs' consultations with their distinguished persons are neither official nor public, the chiefs willingly lend an ear to these male and female advisers, particularly since in earlier years many of them were sorcerers or were in charge of the ceremonies at religious festivities."" (Erdland, 1914, p. 74)

The ri-kanan or ri-kanij is called the 'sorcerer' in my translation of Erdland, though 'magician' or simply 'religious specialist' might be more appropriate. The power of this figure, while often great, appears to have been personal rather than institutional:

""In the Marshall Islands the magnetic energy of the soul is increased through the influence of the sun. Whoever wants to become a sorcerer exposes his tongue to the sun for hours, while lying on his back. Only after the sun's rays have been absorbed for weeks is the tongue capable of sending rays at men, animals, and inanimate beings. This magic power is enhanced by qualities peculiar to animals and, above all, plants. In most cases, however, the use of external means is resorted to only to increase the authority of the sorcerer and to gain power over deluded neighbors. Quite by itself the influence of the sorcerer extends to all spheres: spiritual beings, illness and health, life and death, emotions, animals, plants, weather, currents, and other natural phenomena. Deeply rooted superstitions complete the nimbus of the sorcerer."" (Erdland, 1914, p. 255)","dobbin2011[121-138];erdland2010[74, 230-283]"

18474,marshall-islands,86,3,150-3,"‘Social and Political Structure; Right of Succession’ (Erdland, 1914, pp. 71-78)

Erdland describes a system of 'subchiefs' paying loose allegiance to 'high chiefs'. How this system related to local communities is not quite clear:

""The natives distinguish two social groups, noblemen and commoners, each of which is divided into two subdivisions: 

""Noblemen:

""a) iroj, high nobleman, whose political position is that of high chief;

[72] ""b) buirak, nobleman, whose political position is that of subchief; 

""Commoners: 

""a) läadökdök, distinguished person, whose political position is that of adviser;

""b) kajur, commoner, whose political position is that of subject. 

""... Politically speaking, a buirak holds the rank of an iroj in relation to his own subjects, and they call him their political iroj. They must obey him absolutely. A buirak has absolute ownership rights over his landed properties and may give them away or sell them at will … The landed property of a buirak may be much more extensive than that of an iroj … [73] … Through marriages and inheritance each iroj has one or another buirak who pays tribute to him. The subchief puts his subjects at the high chief's disposal for free labor, fights for him, and supports him in the most important matters. In case of serious disputes, however, the subchief withdraws and goes his own way until there is a reconciliation.

“Both the high chief and the subchief exercise their power and authority exclusively with regard to their own territories. Therefore, when Kabua made a treaty with the German government in 1878 concerning a protectorate over the Ralik group, he overstepped his rights, since his cousin owned much more land in the Ralik group and was also held in higher esteem. Needless to say, he was even less entitled to agree to a German protectorate over both groups. His designation in the treaty as ‘King and Lord’ was merely a political maneuver.

“From a political point of view an iroj may be merely a subchief on an atoll."" (Erdland, 1914, pp. 71-73)

‘Rights of chiefs’ (Erdland. 1914, pp. 78-84)

“Chiefs of the first and second rank are the sole landowners. All landed property belongs to them, either through inheritance from ancestors and relatives or though warfare. Each island is divided into several clearly demarcated parcels that extend from the lagoon shore to the outer shore and are individually named. It is rare, indeed, that all the land of an island belongs to a single chief. Usually one chief owns this piece and another chief owns that one, or as the saying goes: one “hut” (iem) belongs to this chief, the other to that one … These ‘huts’ or pieces of land are cultivated by the subjects of the chief, and, of course, according to the owner's wishes. Some subjects have lived for generations on the same piece of land, while others, exiles of the feudal system, have been transferred to land of inferior value. Not a single bondsman has title to the land he cultiyates; each one is wholly dependent on the [Page 79] chief, who may remove him from the cultivated land at any time. One must keep this situation in mind in order to understand the sweeping authority of the chiefs.” (Erdland, 1914, pp. 78-79)

Mason (1947, pp. 37-47, 'Territorial organization') provides a clearer description. Most atolls were divided into districts (bukon), each of which contained multiple settlements (ene or jikin kwelok). Settlements consisted of multiple bwij ('families' or lineages), each of which had a head (alap), but there seems to have been no head of the settlement as a whole. The bukon was headed by either a lineage head (alap) or a 'lesser chief' (iroj erik). Bukon heads owed allegiance to 'high chiefs' (iroj labalap). In this situation there would have been two levels of jurisdiction beyond the local community. Sometimes there was another level, 'atoll chief', which would have constituted three levels.

Settlements:

“The basic territorial unit in Marshallese society was and still is the settlement. The natives call it jikin kwelok (place of assembly) if something in the nature of a village is considered; generally, they say ene, the term for island. Settlements take the name of the island on which they are located. Only infrequently does one island have more than one community, in which case the several swellings of population are given [Page 41] separate names but are generally grouped under the island name for casual reference. Any Marshallese settlement is really a series of homesteads strung like beads along the narrow roadway that courses the length of the island. Populations of settlements vary from 15 to over 250, probably averaging about 100, or nearly equivalent to the American rural neighborhood.” (Mason, 1947, pp. 40-41)

“The only officials of any sort common to all settlements are the alaps, the headmen of those families (bwij) which occupy the dwelling units and control the strips of property from lagoon to ocean beach. A single dwelling unit may be occupied by all members of a small bwij, but in most cases, a single bwij comprises several nuclear families each of which probably inhabits a single dwelling. A settlement of 150 people may have [42] 30 dwellings but only 20 bwij and, thus, 20 alaps. On the other hand, a single population group of two or three households may consist of only 15 people under a single slap. In matters which are of local concern only, the alaps are sufficient authority, but in larger matters their responsibility merges with that of atoll officialdom.” (Mason, 1947, pp. 41-42)

Districts:

""Atoll populations are composed of a varying number of separate island settlements ... Some atolls have only one settlement and that on the main island; larger atolls may have 15 or 20 settlements, and two or three on the largest island. Generally, an atoll is divided into several bukons, or districts, each embracing a number of island settlements in one segment of the atoll and centering on the principal island in that segment. Informants insist that the bukon is an old Marshallese concept, useful then, as new, in population administration.” (Mason, 1947, p. 42)

Authority at the district level and above:

“The native political structure has always been bound up inseparably with ownership of land by the clan, or more realistically by the paramount chief of the clan … The paramount chiefs (iroij labalap) continue to hold their positions by right of inheritance; as long as a legitimate heir exists, the traditional [43] rules of matrilineal succession are adhered to. The lesser chiefs (iroij erik) succeed their predecessors in the same manner and continue allegiance to the same royal lineage as did their forefathers in the old days of civil strife. At the bottom of the native hierarchy, the alaps in turn serve the lesser chiefs and render tribute to them on demand.” (Mason, 1947, pp. 42-43)

""The connection between bukon and atoll or super-atoll leadership varies from one part of the Marshalls to another. Many atolls may fall under the jurisdiction of a single paramount chief, is in the case of the late Tomeing who lived at Wotje. He received tribute, as iroij labalap, from his lesser chiefs (iroij erik) at Ailuk, Utirik, Wotje, Aur, and Maloalap atolls, within each of which the iroij erik have the allegiance of the bukon leaders, be they alaps or minor iroij erik. On the other hand, Arno and Majuro atolls each have a pair of 'kings,' who control a population of the islands relative to their traditional authority, but who are independent of each other. The Ralik Chain to the west has long been integrated under the combined rule of five chiefly families; that is to say, some Ralik atolls like Lae and Ujae are controlled entirely by one of these families, but larger atolls like Jaluit and Ailinglapalap are shared in varying propertions by all five.""

'Religion and magic' (Erdland, 1914, pp. 230-283)

Religious authority in the Marshall Islands appears to have been diffuse. Chiefs were regarded as sacred (Dobbin, 2011, p. 123), but there is little indication that they played an active role in religious ritual, though the chief did set the date for the pandanus ceremony (Dobbin, 2011, p. 134).

Religious figures called ri-kanan or ki-kanij are the only religious specialists missioned in missionary accounts, but Dobbin also mentions a 'combined magician-sorcerer-soothsayer-master of ceremonies' called the läadökdök:

""In the past there was a figure in the Marshalls who was famous for this divining, the ri-bubu, but early writers Knappe and Erdland told only about a general sort of religious figure called the ri-kanan or ri-kanij, who performed a strange ritual of stretching out prone on the ground and sticking out his tongue in order to absorb the power of the sun (Erdland 1914, 332). For the contemporary Marshalls, the general titles are broken down into specialties:

""Diviner ri-bubu

""Sorcerer ri-anijnij

""Magician ri-ekapal

""Medicine maker ri-uno

""Storyteller ri-bwebwenato

""Certainly the sorcerers, magicians, and medicine makers—people with extraordinary power and connection to the spirit world—were in this sense leaders or specialists in the old religion. According to Erdland, the [126] combined magician-sorcerer-soothsayer-master of ceremonies (läadökdök) stood as the 'third rank' in Marshallese society, below the high and lower ranked chiefs (1914, 343)."" (Dobbin, 2011, pp. 125-126)

In Erdland, it is clear that while läadökdök often organised religious ceremonies they were not religious specialists per se, but rather commoners who were favoured by chiefs and acted as their unofficial advisers:

""A distinguished person, läadökdök (äadök, 'strong, powerful'), is a common subject who has distinguished himself through intellectual ability or outstanding services on land or sea and who as a reward has received more or less extensive lands as estates in fee from a high chief or subchief. Distinction and title are hereditary. It is the duty of such a ditinguished person, whose position is comparable to that of our middle-class citizen, to help the chief in every way. Although the chiefs' consultations with their distinguished persons are neither official nor public, the chiefs willingly lend an ear to these male and female advisers, particularly since in earlier years many of them were sorcerers or were in charge of the ceremonies at religious festivities."" (Erdland, 1914, p. 74)

The ri-kanan or ri-kanij is called the 'sorcerer' in my translation of Erdland, though 'magician' or simply 'religious specialist' might be more appropriate. The power of this figure, while often great, appears to have been personal rather than institutional:

""In the Marshall Islands the magnetic energy of the soul is increased through the influence of the sun. Whoever wants to become a sorcerer exposes his tongue to the sun for hours, while lying on his back. Only after the sun's rays have been absorbed for weeks is the tongue capable of sending rays at men, animals, and inanimate beings. This magic power is enhanced by qualities peculiar to animals and, above all, plants. In most cases, however, the use of external means is resorted to only to increase the authority of the sorcerer and to gain power over deluded neighbors. Quite by itself the influence of the sorcerer extends to all spheres: spiritual beings, illness and health, life and death, emotions, animals, plants, weather, currents, and other natural phenomena. Deeply rooted superstitions complete the nimbus of the sorcerer."" (Erdland, 1914, p. 255)","dobbin2011[121-138];erdland2010[74, 230-283]"

The Kalinga were divided into 'regions', each of which contained multiple 'villages':

""KALINGA society is based primarily on the bilateral kinship group, a development of the tribal priciple of social organization (the 'blood tie'), and secondarily on a territorial unit, hereafter called the 'region,' which consists of certain villages and their surrounding lands."" (Barton, 1949, p. 32)

'Social organization' (Dozier, 1966, pp. 53-126)

'Headhunting, warfare, and the peace-pact institution' (Dozier, 1966, pp. 197-237).

At the time of Barton's fieldwork, political control was mostly in the hands of 'pangats', powerful men who were 'selected by a long informal process whereby they grow in population influence and recognition' (Barton, 1949, p. 147). There were two other indigenous statuses that resembled political offices. The first was that of 'go-between' (mangi-ungud).'Go-betweens' were mediators who had the right to punish breaches of the peace during negotiations. Barton describes them as 'functionaries of the territorial unit' since they were required to act independently of kinship ties. However, the position does not appear to have been a permanent one - rather, 'go-betweens' for appointed for the duration of an important dispute (p. 164). The second was 'pact-holder' (mangdon si budong - Barton, 1949, p. 167). The pact-holder was responsible for enforcing a 'peace-pact' with another region. The multiple pact-holders in a given region do appear to have constituted a loosely organized 'level of jurisdiction' at the regional level.

However, this system was of very recent origin. Barton (1949, p. 167) insists that the peace-pact institution existed prior the the arrival of American control. This appears to be the case, but only just. Dozier argues that it did not pre-date the turn of the century (Dozier, 1966, p. 212) whereas American control began around 1902 (Dozier, 1966, p. 37). Presumably the roles of 'pangat' and 'go-between', but not 'pact-holder', existed prior to this.

The fact that the Kalinga were under American control for much of the period complicates matters further. A system of local government based on the Spanish system was implemented and was partially integrated with the indigenous system (Dozier, 1966, pp. 36, 38-39).

Pangats:

""Pangats are powerful individuals who have been selected by a long informal process whereby they grow in population influence and recognition and are elevated to the rank in which the domestic aspect of the Kalinga state is lodged.

""In the eyes of the people the pangats' main function is to make peace when trouble arises ... But people go to them for advice and assistance in all kinds of matters ... [148] ... Elevation to rank and power in the community is a gradual process of emergence in which the power is attained before the rank is acknowledged by the people. So it is in Kalinga."" (Barton, 1949, pp. 147-148)

'Go-betweens':

""By derivation, the Kalinga word mangi-ugud, which I translate as 'go-between,' means 'advocate,' 'conferrer.' The derivation thus implies far less power and greater limitations than the Latin arbiter, less, too, than the English word 'arbitrator.' This implication is correct so far as power in settling disputes is concerned, for in that respect the go-between's function is only 'trying to arrange a settlement' between kinship groups involved in controversy, but in another respect his power and duty are vastly greater. For all that, the Kalinga go-between is not nearly so important a functionary as the Ifugao, for the reason, probably that much of his function is performed by the pangats.

""In all-important or serious cases there is a go-between, and often there are two of them, on each side. Go-betweens are functionaries of the territorial social unit, as well as of kinship groups. If selected by the pangats, they are formally so, of course. But they are essentially so in any case. For, however selected, they are, as has been said, in honour bound to punish infractions of the peace by either side while mediation is in process with death or wounding; also they are honour bound not to pay weregilds in such cases. That is to say, they carry out an execution sanctioned by the whole region."" (Barton, 1949, p. 164)

'Pact-holders':

""The pact-holder has a dual office: (1) he is spokesman of his own region in its relations with another and (2) he is an agent of that other town in its dealings with his own and the righter, often the avenger, of wrongs against it ... The office of pact-holder is inherited and allotted in much the same way that property is."" (Barton, 1949, p. 170)

Recency of the peace-pact institution:

""The peace pact, budong, enforced by a pact-holder, appears to be a specifically Kalinga development. Pangat Dugyang and MR. Dakauwag have the feeling that it is comparatively recent but can give no reasons for the belief. The following consideration argues in favour of the view that it is a comparatively late institution, although it undoubtedly reaches back before the coming of the Americans: the nature of the institution is obviously such that it would propagate itself rapidly, and indeed, it has expanded its area even during American times."" (Barton, 1949, p. 167)

""The Kalinga peace-pact institution (Bodong) is obviously a response to recent historical developments. The former regional isolationism of the Kalinga was broken by Western cultural penetration, particularly by creating opportunities for trade and travel. The earliest dates on which peace pacts were actually established occur around the turn of the century ... Negotiations for such pacts very likely began earlier, possibly with the opening of the Spanish military 'road' or trail from Abra over the Cordillera Central into the Saltan and Chico valleys during the latter part of the nineteenth century. As interregional travel and trade became more common during the first and second decades of the present century the number of peace pacts increased ... Given the traditional animosity between regions, the headhunting practices, and the vengeance system, measures to safeguard the inter-regional traveller had to be taken when extensive travelling became feasible. The Kalinga's answer to this problem was the peace pact which is simply a more formal adjudication system already employed to deal with intraregional, intra-kindred problems. The peace-pact system is, therefore, not something revolutionarily new. The Kalinga, like other mountain peoples of northern Luzon, have a complex legal system, obviously very old, to handle local regional problems. This body of procedures was simply incorporated into the peace-pact system and now these 'laws' are called upon to resolve intra-regional problems as well."" (Dozier, 1966, p. 212)

Changes under American administration:

""There is no evidence that the Spanish system of municipal government, operating through appointed or elected presidente, concejal, and teniente was actually instituted in the Kalinga country before the American period. This system of local government was, however, established in Abra and the Ilocos areas and Kalinga traders were familiar with it. It was therefore understandable that the municipal form of government was adopted without apparent resistance when the mountain people came under American administration and has been adjusted to traditional government patterns on the local level throughout the Mountain Province."" (Dozier, 1966, p. 36)

""A few remarks about the activities of the first lieutenant ogovernor of Kalinga (1907-1915), Walter Franklin Hale, are in order here ... [39] ... Kalinga credit Hale for bringing down the incidence of headhunting, and establishing law and order throughout the subprovince ... In all matters that did not conflict seriously with governmental regulations, Hale modified rules to fit existing traditional practices ... Early in his administration, Hale recognized the existence of regional units where certain influential leaders or pangngats exercised authority and received the respect of the local population. Such units were asked to name their most influential pangnat to represent them. Each regional unit then had a spokesman upon whom Hale conferred the title of presidente ... The presidente was given an army coat and a small salary to establish his authority ... Hale realized that the Kalinga were not yet prepared to function in terms of the larger municipal districts, and he reinforced the traditional Kalinga consciousness of territorial regions. It was not until toward the end of the American period that the larger municipal districts began to have a meaning for the Kalinga, and even today peace pacts are made between the traditional territorial units. Important municipal officers are now elected, yet the old local units tend to support their own candidates."" (Dozier, 1966, p. 39)

""Kalinga society reflects in the pangat, in the peace pact with pact-holder to enforce it, in its defined boundaries, in its definite citizenship, with provisions for formal change of citizenship, and in its detailed and human treaties with other regions a higher political development than any other Philippine people, so far as has been reported. The virility of these institutions and the hold that they have on the Kalingas are manifested by the fact that they function almost or quite as efficiently and extensively now and under-ground, after thirty-odd years of foreign rule, as they did before that rule, so that, has has already been said, the Kalingas are really subject to two governments, one native, one foreign ... [147] ... Governor Walter A. Hale ... perceived the genius of several Kalinga institutions, fortified them, and gave them a field wherever they could be useful. So, too, did his Filipino assistant and successor, Governor Thomas Blanco. But succeeding native governors have looked on them as resistance to Filipinization.""

‘Priests’ existed. They clearly had 'religious authority' in that only they could offer sacrifices. Each priest was associated with a cemetery and offered sacrifices to the people buried there on behalf of their surviving kin. Hence the group over which a priest exercised authority consisted of the kin of those buried in the cemetery, who were also the worshippers of the latter. Most of this 'congregation', but not all, would have resided in the same district, since people usually worshipped the ancestors who were buried in the cemetery closest to them. However, they would rarely have included the entire population of a district, since districts usually had more than one cemetery. Ngwane-inoto (big men) also played a religious role to in that they gained prestige by organising sacrifices. Some were also priests. However, there is no indication that they were generally believed to have privileged access to the supernatural. 

""I have mentioned that the people do not live in villages but in isolated homesteads. Mountain ridges and streams, however, serve to divide the country into small districts … The residents of each of these areas are marked off from the rest of the community in a variety of ways. Thus they combine under their own leader to carry out all sorts of communal work, such as clearing land for new gardens and avenging wrongs committed by outsiders, take a pride in their local traditions, and refer to themselves by the name of the territory they occupy … Groupings of this type are in some respects similar to localised clans, so common elsewhere. A clan, however, is by definition unilateral … Clans, again, are always exogamous …  [26] … The members of a Malaita district group, on the other hand, though able to trace their descent from a common ancestor, regard ties through males and ties through females as of equal importance, and feel no repugnance at marriage amongst themselves … In rather more than two-thirds of the unions, nevertheless, the partners do come from different districts, and when this is so the sons have the right to erect their dwellings and make gardens in the territories of either of their parents. This right is even extended, and a person may go and live in any of the areas where an ancestor has dwelt – an ancestor, that is, from whom he is descended directly through males or through males and females.

""The natives themselves express this right not in terms of where the ancestor dwelt but of where he is buried and worshipped. In each district there is a couple of sacred groves, always easy to locate because the bush in the vicinity is never cut down, and in consequence huge ficus and banyan trees tower over the surrounding jungle. At death the person’s body is buried in one of the sacred groves of the area where his house was situated, and his descendants offer up sacrifices at intervals near his grave. Since the number of ancestors increases with every receding generation, and as marriages outside the district are of frequent occurrence, it follows that a person who wishes to worship all his forebears has to make sacrifices in many different places, and that in each one of these he has the right of residence. In practice he usually restricts the number to those whose graves are within a convenient distance, and the choice of districts to which he may belong is narrowed down considerably."" (Hogbin, 1939, pp 25-26)

""The ritual of sacrifice has been described in connection with the position of the ngwane-inoto. The facts there given indicate that offerings on a large scale - with the subsequent feasts and dances - are the principal method of acquiring social prestige. Though this is fully recgonized by native opinion, the ostensible object of the ceremonies is to secure the goodwill of the spirits, and this aim is at least as important to the participants … It is usual to select a single group of ancestors for regular worship, generally those buried in the cemetery closest to where the man lives. A ngwane-inoto initiates feasts in honour of this group only, preserving contact with the remainder by making contributions to feasts organised by others. Lesser members of the community similarly make the bulk of their offerings to the ancestors near whose graves they live, with only occasional sacrifices to other spirits. A change is sometimes made if the place of residence is altered, but this in itself, as was mentioned, is of rare occurrence. The offering of a sacrifice always involves the presence of at least one priest, since they alone know the ritual procedure which has to be gone through when the spirits are approached.  [106] Each cemetery has its own priest who has to give his approval before any offering can be made to the spirits of the persons buried there. The office is held by hereditary right, being transmitted from father to son, but is by no means a full-time job, and apart from his special position at ceremonies the priest lives the life of an ordinary man. Several in fact are ngwane-inoto."" (Hogbin, 1939, pp 105-106)","hogbin1939[25-26, 102-121]"
18816,kiribati,86,2,150-2,"Political organisation in the Gilbert Islands seems to have rarely gone beyond the local community, i.e. the 'maneaba district', though 'paramount chiefs' existed on a few islands:

‘Political structure’ (Grimble & Maude, 1989, pp. 151-155)

“Political structure in the Gilbert Group was sharply divided. In the southern islands there were democracies, with elected chiefs for purposes of war; in the north there were aristocracies founded on conquest. But such aristocracies may be again divided into two classes: those that submitted to a single overlord, or high chief, which may be called feudal systems; and those that submitted to no overlord or high chief, which we may call democratic aristocracies.

“It was among the pure democracies and the feudal populations that government was most highly developed. In the former, councils of the elders known for their wisdom held the reins and punished offenders. Under high chiefs all obeyed a single voice. But among the democratic aristocracies there was no general cohesion in times of peace. Each clan, with its slaves, owed obedience to its own chief, with his councillors drawn from the clan. Every chief was equal, and a separate entity."" (Grimble & Maude, 1989, p. 151)

""Character of democratic government

“If there were no conflicting interests on an island the entire population was subject to a single council of Old Men. It is not to be supposed that this was a highly organized body, nor that its meetings were regular or periodical … [153] … Usually there were two or three different factions on an island, in which case each faction would have its own council of elders."" (Grimble & Maude, 1989, pp. 152-153)

""The political development of the island influenced the manner of living on the land. Under the democracies there were few villages. Landowners lived on their own land scattered about the district of the faction to which they belonged. There was a central maneaba (or council and dance house) for their faction district.

""Under high chiefs there was a royal village complete with the central [155] maneaba of the island. This village included the king's dwellings and his wives’ houses, the dwellings of members of the royal blood, and the slave quarters.

""Under divided chiefs there were clan villages."" (Grimble & Maude, 1989, pp. 154-155)

“Tabiteua, with over 5,000, was the most populous island; Abaiang, Tarawa, Abemama and Nonouiti all had between 2500 and 3500; Butaritari-Makin, Marakei, Beru, Nikunau and Onotoa had between 1500 and 2500; Aranuka, Kuria, Tamana and Arorare had fewer than 1500 people ... In pre-European times the Gilbertese did not live in the large consolidated villages which now characterise their islands. The basic [7] residential unit was the kainga – a hamlet, sometimes walled for privacy, within which a number of related extended families lived in separate mwenge, or households … On the bush (usually the eastern) side of the settlement there was a bangota or shrine to the ancestral gods or spirits recognised by the klinga … Although there was no defined priesthood it was customary for one family from within the kainga to lead worship and to interpret the natural signs – changes in winds and clouds, for example – which were seen as conveying messages from the gods … Each kainga had also had a totemic object – fish or birds were most common – which its members did not hunt or eat. 

“On all islands except Makin and Butaritari, each kainga was associated with a maneaba or meeting-house. Together with subsidiary kawa which had been established when the original settlements had become overcrowded, the kainga of a district were usually scattered along the western, or lagoon, side of an island with most being in close proximity to the maneaba. The maneaba was a large rectangular peaked roof, sometimes more than thirty metres in length and half as wide, set on low coral pillars. It was the social and political centre of its district and also served as a temporary residence for visitors who had no close kin in the district. Within the maneaba, each kainga had a defined sitting place called a boti or inaki. The oldest male of the kainga was usually its head and also its leading spokesman. Although wilful movement from one boti to another was not permitted, an individual was entitled to take his place in any boti to which he could trace his descent through the male line and, under some circumstances, could be invited into another … A man usually took his place in his father’s boti, a woman in her husband’s. In the southern Gilberts some boti leaders were regarded with greater sanctity than others and some kainga were, [8] at least in a practical or military sense, more powerful than their neighbours. On both these grounds the Karongoa n Uea clan which traced its descent back to Samoa often assumed, and was recognised as having, a degree of precedence. In essence, however, the various boti and the kainga they represented were seen as approximately equal, though competing, elements of a single district community. A man with military prowess might rise to a position of prominence but his leadership was transitory; there was no place for a chiefly dynasty in the southern Gilberts … When possible, disputes amongst kainga members were kept out of the maneaba but when two or more kainga were concerned maneaba involvement was usually inevitable. When participants refused to [9] accept the arbitration of the unimane, or old men, recourse to arms would follow. As a general rule, violence was more common between than within maneaba districts … In the islands stretching northwards from the equator to Marakei, the chiefly system survived the depredations of Kaitu and Uakeia although maneaba councils became an important restraint on chiefly power. In most cases one kainga in each district assumed a pre-eminent position although in practice its leader was more of a warlord than a paramount chief. The maneaba existed with a boti arrangement parallel to that of the southern islands but district government tended to revolve around the chief rather than the maneaba council. Wars in the pursuit of land and power were common and on Abemama-Kuria-Aranuka, and to a lesser extent on Abaiang, centralised leadership emerged. On Abemama and its two satellite islands, however, this authority was only consolidated by a monopoly of trade and its rewards (including firearms) in the 19th century, while on Abaiang a paramount chief did not emerge until after European contact and his power was only effective and unchallenged for brief periods.

“The strong centralised chiefship that unified Butaritari and Makin was an exception in the Gilbert Islands …” (Macdonald, 1982, pp. 6-9)

One 'clan' (Karongoa n Uea) had ceremonial and to some extent political precedence in maneaba government throughout the Gilbert Islands, though chiefs, where they they existed, often belonged to other kin groups. However, it is not clear that members of this clan had any authority or privileges in maneaba other than those in which they resided:

On the predence of Karongoa n Uea in the Gilbert Islands:

“Many clans had hereditary privileges or duties connected with the ceremonial of the maneaba, which they most jealously prized and guarded. Among these, the group of Karongoa n Uea ‘Karongoa of Kings’, as its name suggests, was foremost in rank. Karongoa n Uea was king of the maneaba; at all ceremonial gatherings within the edifice, its chief man—the senior descendant through eldest sons of the original ancestor—assumed ‘the first word and the last word’ in debate … [220] … Attached to Karongoa n Uea was a very clear-cut doctrine of infallibility concerning certain race traditions … [221] … A Gilbertese explanation of the pre-eminence of this clan in the ceremonial of the maneaba is that ‘it is Samoa’; that is to say, it represents the victorious immigration from Samoa into the Gilbert Islands.” (Grimble & Maude, 1989, pp. 219-221)

“Though there can be no doubt that the people of Karongoa n Uea came as conquerors and chiefs to the group, their prestige in the maneaba is now entirely divorced from the idea of temporal power, and their privileges are largely independent of political vicissitudes.

""On Abemama, indeed, where the high chiefs belong to the clan of Kaburara, the insolently despotic Tem Binoka of fifty years ago, whose particular pleasure it was to override all Gilbertese custom and so display his power, became jealous of Karongoa's ceremonial prerogatives and deliberately assumed them to himself. Since then Kaburara has performed on Abemama all the offices in the maneaba that used to be in the hands of Karongoa n Uea …  The deliberate stroke of disorganization which Binoka was obliged to effect on Abemama, in order to rob Karongoa of its precedence, only serves to throw into greater relief the durable character of its privileges, for before their spoliation they had subsisted intact through six successive generations of powerful high chiefs. Their eventual loss for political reasons was quite exceptional, being without parallel on any other Gilbert island. Elsewhere, whatever may have been the accidents of war or other material circumstances, Karongoa remained supreme in the maneaba from the time of the Samoan immigration right up to the coming of the British flag in 1892.” (Grimble, 1989, p. 223)",grimble-maude1989[151-155];macdonald1982[6-9]

'Social organization' (Dozier, 1966, pp. 53-126)

'Religion' (Dozier, 1966, pp. 159-196)

The only religious specialists mentioned in the sources are 'mediums' or 'priest(esse)s' (mang-alisig, mangdada-wak, mang-anito). Mediums appear to have had a degree of authority in that they were clearly distinguished from the rest of the population and were apparently the only ones who could 'officiate' at certain rituals. 

“The priesthood is almost entirely in the hands of women. Entry into it is always in answer to ‘call’ and is, in a sense, compulsory; the woman begins to sleep badly, has many dreams, grows thin, lacks appetite, believed that her soul has married an anitu and that she can extricate herself from the condition only by becoming a priestess (mana-alisig) … She is said to be taught the rituals by the gods themselves, not by the older priestesses. But, of course, she has been watching and hearing these since she was a little girl and wondering whether fate would call her to be a priestess when she grew older … About one out of fifty women are priestesses. For their officiations they receive the lower jaw and jowls of the pig and half of the liver, or if they have plenty of meat at home already, fifteen bundles of rice, a ganta of mangos, or a peso or two. They never ask for a fee.

“Men are much more rarely priests, but there are a few, and some of them have great renown. Priests formerly concerned themselves mainly with head-hunting rites, but, now that there is little or no use for these, there is little use for priests, except the few exceptional ones who undertake to cure sickness.” (Barton, 1949, p. 24)

""The only professional position for men or women among the mountain peoples is that of the medium, mang-alising (Lubuagan), mandadawak, mang-anito (northern Kalinga). This position is nowhere a fulltime occupation nor are there organizations of mediums with graded or specialized functions except incipiently among the Ifugao ... We have already noted that religious practitioners are men among the Bontoc and Ifugao, whereas among the Tinguian, Kalinga and Apayao (Isnegs) they are women ... [174] ... The profession of a medium is not closed to men among the northern groups, but these peoples feel that such positions are properly for women. Among the Kalinga, mediums are perhaps accorded the least distinction anywhere in the Mountain Province. Men frequently refer to them deprecatingly as 'quack doctors,' and informants are inclined to mask their importance, yet will seek their services in times of illness and death ... A Kalinga medium wears a turban, bayobong, made out of barkcloth and during the performance of a ceremony she carries a Chinese plate which she rings with a bamboo stick as she chants. Other common items which form a characteritic part of the medium's ritual paraphernalia are the following: headaxe, coconut shells, tools such as grub hoe and bolo, various types of ferns and hibiscus flowers ... While not all the items in each medium's ritual collection are the same, some, such as the barkcloth turban, the Chinese plate with bamboo stick, and the basket which contains these items are standard. A medium sacrifices a chicken in most rites but for the major ones, for example, those involving serious illnesses and funeral rites, the sacrificial victim is one or more pigs ... [175] ... The Kalinga medium has no set fee for her services. As payment, she may receive the choicest part of the meat of the sacrificial victims, beads, money, clothes, or tools such as a headaxe, knife, or grub hoe. Such payment is never high and personal profit appears to have no part in the Kalina medium's dedicated service ... The activities of the Kalinga mediums are similar to classic shamanistic performances the world over ... [178] ... A medium and her helpers usually perform their rites at night, but the preparations and the feast that are part of the curing ceremony ordinarily start in the the afternoon of one day and go on to about mid-morning of the next day.

""In public or semi-public ritual, mediums do not restrict themselves to the immediate purposes of the ceremony. They are also entertainers. They may dance, sing (besides the chants), or admonish people about proper behaviour ... The ceremonies in which mediums perform are not solemn occasions; there is much joking among the spectators, and the mediums themselves are often engaged in conversation and in humorous bantering."" (Dozier, 1966, pp. 173-178)

Whether they exercised authority over a defined 'group' is less clear. Dozier claims that a medium was 'obligated to answer a request for her services regardless of when or by whom she is asked' (Dozier, 1966, p. 175). However, it seems likely that this obligation only applied to people living in the same region, since Dozier elsewhere describes a strong sentiment that 'people from other regions, whether Kalinga or not, are not to be trusted, and that one has no responsibility towards them' (Dozier, 1966, p. 53).  

Mediums are described as officiating at the village-level sagang ceremony, which is the largest-scale ceremony described in the sources. Hence mediums as a group could be said to have had religious authority over the village, to the extent that only a medium was able to perform this ceremony:

 ""There are no community welfare ceremonies like the Begnas ceremony of Sagada ... at present among the Kalinga, although the earlier headhunting ceremony, sagang, appears to have been such an event."" (Dozier, 1966, p. 186)

""The returning headhunters proceeded to the village from which the leader had come or from which most of the party had been drawn. Here excitement and shouts of joy greeted the warriors, and the potol, or evidence of the kill, was examined. Preparations for rituals and festivities began at once ... The medium and her helpers ... performed the sagang ceremony. The chants of this ceremony were no longer remembered by my infromants, but the medium was said to petition sangasang, the guardian of the village, to bestow long life on the warriors.""

21173,Pohnpei,84,3,149-3,"‘The old cultic centers’ (Dobbin, 2011, pp. 80-93)

“Much of the tradition about the Pohnpeian religion before the twentieth century focuses on the three great ritual centers at Salapwuk, Wene, and Nan Madol.” (Dobbin, 2011, p. 80)

Salapwuk:

“From the oral histories of the priest-chiefs at the Salapwuk center, it appears that the site was a religious, ritual center perhaps dating back to between AD 1 and 500, a time frame that certainly predates the period when Nan Madol was an active political and ritual center (200). The earliest date of settlement at the Wene ritual sites is AD 408 (Ayres and Haun 1981; Mauricio 1993, 279). On the basis of both archaeological evidence and oral history, it is likely that the beginnings of the ritual center at Wene parallel the main construction at Nan Madol between AD 1000 and 1500. The reigning priest-chief there broadened the base of his territory during the Sapwataki wars about AD 1700. Sometime after the victory of the Wene priest-chief, he assumed or was given the title of the autonomous paramount chief of Nahnmwarki of Kitti. By the time of the first extensive Western exploration and ethnography (Christian 1899; Hambruch’s work in 1910 was not published until 1932 and 1936), Nan Madol, Salapwuk, and Wene were no longer functioning as cultic centers, and the priests across the island had already died out.” (Dobbin, 2011, p. 81)

“When Salapwuk became an important center is not clear in the traditional accounts. These accounts maintain, however, that there was a time before [82] Salapwuk and the other centers, a time when religion was not so focused and organized, when there were no ceremonies (Bernart 1977, 65) … The person who supposedly changed all that was the priest-chief called the Soumwen Leng: ‘He was the man who started a ceremony to the high god entitled Daukatau,’ wrote Luelen Bernart (1977, 65). The ceremony may have centered on the conferral of the very Soumwen Leng title that the high priest at Salapwuk received from Daukatau. In any case, the introduction of ritual and titles is viewed as the beginning of organized religion on Pohnpei. Besides serving as priest-chief, Soumen Leng was also said to be the first diviner or prophet on Pohnpei, predicting the great flood that he and his family all survived. He was also the priest-leader of the Salapwuk area, although little is known about how he governed the area.

“Today the Salapwuk area is still well known to Pohnpeians, although its function as an active ritual center died out at least a century ago (Mauricio 1993, 222). It is well remembered because Salapwuk and the Soumwen Leng represent the beginnings of the title and ranking system that continues to dominate Pohnpeian culture …  [83] … The main function of Soumwen Leng was to preside over rituals to ensure good crops and harvest, to obtain good weather, and to set the annual calendar. 21 Some of the rituals performed by Soumwen Leng and his priests were closed to all but the priests; others demanded the participation of the entire community. One ritual for good weather, attended by the whole community, is described below as it was recorded by Hambruch in 1910 … Other rituals, too, are associated with Soumwen Leng. He gathered together his priests at an enclosure at Salapwuk to pray for a bountiful harvest (Hambruch 1936a, 135ff.). He led rituals to attract fish to the nearby fishing grounds (Mauricio 1993, 246). He was also called upon to prophesy future events and was sought as a diviner to help make decisions—functions that may be related to his role in determining the calendar by astronomical observations. He was expected to set the times for festivals and ritual days in the annual calendar because it was believed that ‘he knew the secret of the passage of time’ (244). His role in this regard may have even extended well beyond his own territory, so that he was fixing the dates for worship and festivals across Pohnpei.” (Dobbin, 2011, pp. 81-83)

Wene:

“The high priest of Wene, Soukisen Leng, although he originally received his title at the hands of the high priest of Salapwuk, eventually was perceived as outranking him. Indeed, Soukisen Leng, who came to prominence after the Saudeleurs, ‘was the greatest priest of all Ponape,’ according to Luelen Bernart (1977, 146). It was Soukisen Leng who made Isohkelekel, the victor over the Saudeleurs, the first paramount chief (Nahnmwarki) of the new polity of Madolenihmw. It was Soukisen Leng, whose role changed from that of a semi-autonomous priest and chief to political leader, who became the first Nahnmwarki of Kitti. The high priests in both Salapwuk and Wene may have served as priestly leaders of their districts, but Soukisen Leng was much more involved than his counterpart from Salapwuk in the politics and political change on Pohnpei.” (Dobbin, 2011, p. 87)

Nan Madol:

“There is a certain irony in the fate of Nan Madol. The more than ninety artificial and man-made islets of the complex represent religion and politics on a grand scale. These basalt structures are so imposingly large that the other ritual centers of Salapwuk and Wene cannot be compared to them. One basalt enclosure, the residence of the Saudeleur ruler in Nan Madol, is almost the size of three American football fields (Morgan 1988, 75). Most of the fifty-eight islets in the ‘upper town’ section of Nan Madol were houses for the priests, elaborate mortuary structures, and places for sacrifice and worship. Neither of the two ancient and influential religious centers, Salapwuk and Wene, had anything resembling the grandiose architecture of Nan Madol. Nonetheless, in the end, the four or five hundred years of the Saudeleur reign seem to have left little mark on the customs of the people. Soumwen Leng of Salapwuk was credited with initiating the title system, a system that still dominates much of Pohnpeian culture. Soukisen Leng of Wene led the shift of the priesthoods into the more secular status of the paramount chiefs, a dual noble line headed by the Nahnmwarki and Nahnken that endures up to the present. Overall, the modern title system with its sakau rituals and its symbolic presentation of the first fruits to the Nahnmwarki is much closer to the rituals at Salapwuk or Wene than to the sacrifice of the turtle at Nan Madol.

“The ritual most closely identified with religion at Nan Madol, as has been noted, was the sacrifice of a turtle to the sacred eel … [90] … Whatever the interpretation of the symbolism of the sacrifice, the rite was powerful enough to remain in force for perhaps two centuries after the fall of the Saudeleurs. It was performed as late as the reign of Luhken Kesik, the paramount chief or Nahnmwarki of Madolenihmw, who died in 1836 (Mauricio 1993, 157). This Nahnmwarki stopped the rituals at Nan Madol because of a squabble between the presiding priests, although the ritual sacrifice may have been performed later at other locations. What follows is Hambruch’s record of the last performance at Nan Madol …” (Dobbin, 2011, pp. 89-90)

Fate of the cultic centres:

“After the wars against Sapwataki (c. AD 1700), Soukisen became the first Nahnmwarki of a united and greatly expanded chiefdom of Kitti. With the successor of Isohkelekel as Nahnmwarki of Madolenihmw and Soukisen of Wene as Nahnmwarki of Kitti, the ritual centers gradually ceased to function and the priestly titles were absorbed into the two royal lines. Undoubtedly the change from ritual centers and priests to ceremonial centers (nahs) and paramount chiefs was a process, not an event. The [93] crowning blow to the old cultic priests came with the smallpox epidemic of 1854, when many of the remaining priests, according to the missionaryphysician Luther Gulick, died as a result of their refusal to accept inoculation from the Christian missionary. With the demise of the ritual centers and their priests, the remains of the old religion of Pohnpei vanished as an institution separate from the secular powers.” (Dobbin, 2011, pp. 92-93)",dobbin2011[80-93]

‘The sou and his officers’ (Gardiner, 1898b, pp. 460-466)

Rotuma was divided into seven 'districts', each of which appears to have consisted of a number of 'villages', each of which consisted of one 'hoag' (kin group). The hoag had a leader called the pure whose role appears to have included settling conflicts within the hoag. Each district had a head, the gagaja, who was assisted by a council and whose functions included dispute resolution and the organisation of economic and military endeavours. Finally, the island had a 'government' consisting of a 'council' headed by a figure called the fakpure:

""The island was formerly sharply divided up into five districts, Noatau to the east, Faguta to the south, ltoteu to the west, and to the north Malaha and Oinafa ... Later Itoinotu (the part cut off) was separated from Itoteu, leaving a part to the west still belonging to Itoteu, but completely separated from it by the new district ... Faguta was divided into two districts, Pepji and Juju, by the other districts after a successful war, to weak-en the power of its chief.

""Each district has a chief of its own, the gagaja, but the chiefs of Noatau and Faguta were the most important and practically ruled over the north and south sides of the island. The government of the whole island was in the hands of a council, formed of the chiefs of the several districts, when they were not at war with one another. The president of this council was the chief of whichever of these two districts, Noatau and Faguta, had conquered the other in the last war; he was called the fakpure. The office of gagaja in each district always remained in the same family; when one died the heads of the families, or hoag, in the district met together and proceeded to elect the most worthy of the same hoag to the office. The hoag then met, and invariably conferred on him the family name; he would be generally the brother, son of an elder brother, or son of the last [429] chief ... The districts were subdivided into hoag, a name applied to all the houses of a family, which were placed together, forming, if the family was a large one, a small village; it is also applied to the family itself. Each of these hoag had a name, which was conferred on one member of the hoag, who was invariably ipso facto its head, or pure ... In most cases, however, the name was given to a brother of the la pure or its oldest member of pure descent, the husband of one of its women not being, appointed its pure or given its name ... [430] ... The power of the gagaja in his district was not arbitrary; he was assisted by a council of the possessors of the hoag names, which might reverse any action of his. Conflicts between the chief and his council were rare so long as his decisions were in accordance with, and he did not infringe, the Rotuman customs. He was called upon to decide disputes about land between hoag, (or within a hoag, if its pure could not settle it; disputes between individuals of different hoag were referred to him. He could call out the district for fish-driving, war, or any work in which all were interested, and had the power of fining any individuals who did not come. If the walls or paths of his district were in disrepair, he ordered out all the hoag, interested, to do the work; he had further to keep a watch to see that a proper number of cocoanut trees were planted, and that all the papoi land was cultivated.” (Gardiner, 1898a, pp. 428-430)

One of the duties of the fakpure and the island council was to care for the sou (sau according to Howard), whose role appears to have been exclusively religious:

""The head chief of the island, or fakpure, was also one of the officers of a spiritual chief, who was termed the sou, but who really had little to do with the government of the island, and  who lived wherever he was placed by the fakpure and the other chiefs. The position seems to have been directly comparable to that of the how of Tonga,' but, while the latter had considerable temporal power, the sou had none ... [461] ... The sou ... had as attendants a number of officers whose duty it [462] was to protect him, at the risk of their own lives, even if he was fighting with their own districts; they were drawn out of all the districts and supposed to be representative men of each ... Their names or titles were in order of precedence mua (chief priest), hagnata, titopu, fakpure (head chief), fanhoga (wife to sou), fahoa, fagata, tonhida (messenger), and mafuida (the presiding officer over all feasts) ... The duty of the sou was simply to see after the proper  performance of the various feasts, all of which had some religious rites. He was however in no way under the priests, of the different atua (p. 468), nor does he seem to have had any coninection with them. It was his business to preside over the feasts, and, whatever might be desired, he had to pray for at the same time as he poured out the kava to the god ... First-fruits from all the districts had to be presented to him, and it was the business of the fakpure to look after this and see that they were properly paid ... [463] ... Of the other officers, the hctgnata, titopu, fahoa, and fagata  formed with some of their people a special guard for the sou, always accompanying him; they usually belonged to four several districts."" (Gardiner, 1898b, pp. 460-463)

What other functions the fakpure had is unclear, but they may have included 'hearing and settling grievances':

""This island is divided into six districts, each ruled by its own chief. 'These meet in congress every six months, when they elect a president and deliberate upon state affairs, hearing and settling grievances without having recourse to arms. Thus intestine broils seldom occur, and when they are inevitable are not very sanguinary."" (Dillon, 1829, quoted in Gardiner, 1898a, p. 400)",gardiner-1898a;gardiner-1898b

At the top was the paramount chief, who was both the secular and sacred head of Kosraean society and who held ultimate title to all land. Under the paramount there were about ten high chiefs, usually male relatives that were appointed by him. The high chiefs, who were obligated to live in Lelu with the paramount, controlled named land units called facl that ran from the high mountains to the reef. There were about fifty such facl  in Kosrae … Below the high chiefs were forty or fifty low chiefs who were land managers or overseers of the facl and who resided on the land for which they were responsible. Agricultural production was primarily the responsibility of the commoners, who occupied the lowest social strata.

18886,kwaio,85,0,151-0,"There were three idealised 'leadership roles' in Kwaio society: 'priest', 'big man' and 'warrior':

""Throughout Malaita, local descent group congregations propitiated their ancestors at shrines presided over at ritual officiants. In northern Malaita, these ‘priests’ are referred to as fataabu (‘speak sacred’). A second leader, at least in the ideal model Malaita peoples have of their own social order, is a Melanesian-style big man, an entrepreneurial feastgiver … The third in the triumvirate of traditional leadership was the ramo or warrior: an assassin, a bounty hunter, a war leader. (Keesing, 1982, p. 11)

Elsewhere, Keesing makes it clear that of the three types of leadership in Malaita society, only priesthood was an office:

""For the religious officiant of a descent group Kwaio most often use wane naa ba'e ‘man of the shrine,’ although the north Malaita fataabu is also in use … For a feastgiving and stability-maintaining leader like 'Elota, Kwaio use wane ba'ita, ‘big man,’ or, mainly in contexts of neo-Maasina Rule leadership, the southern-derived term alafa (‘chief’). Like northern Malaita peoples the Kwaio had ideas of a secular leader whose political sway would be exercised across a broad region; but for these anarchically inclined and fiercely egalitarian hillbillies, this was a unity probably never achieved (the usual label for such a leader, alafa ni gela, ‘Gela Chief,’ belies its alien origin). For a warrior leader / bounty-hunter, Kwaio use lamo, or wane lamo … [243] … In sociological terms, only the ‘priest’ occupied a position every descent group had to fill. A ‘big man’ is ‘big’ only in relative terms, and some descent groups had no prominent secular leader … A group in which a strong feast-giving leader had emerged acted with greater unity, at more intensified levels of production and exchange activity, than  a group without such a leader. But a set of men none of whom was a prominent leader and feastgiver could act together and singly to stage mortuary feasts and organize bridewealth exchanges when the occasion arose … So the wane ba'ita was ‘big’ as a matter of degree; and in no sense was the Big Man a leadership position within the descent group, at least among the Kwaio … So, too, the wane lamo in no sense occupied a position within a Kwaio descent group. As will be seen, such a man was believed to have special ancestrally-conferred powers. But his lamo-ness was a matter of degree and context. While everyone agreed that a small array of feared bounty hunters of the 1920s were lamo … there were many men, warriors of lesser fame and power, who in some contexts would be classed as wane lamo."" (Keesing, 1985, pp 242-245)

Priests appear to have had no official secular functions, though they may have been big-men or warriors at an earlier stage in their lives:

""Some men are oriented primarily toward the sacred, as custodians of ritual knowledge and intermediaries between the group and the spirits. Such priests are not necessarily attributed power in secular pursuits, and have no substantial political role in secular life except as channels through whom [207] the ancestors communicate … But in a number of other cases, a man who in his seventies or eighties was a revered and sacrided priest had decades earlier been a feared warrior or renowned feastgiver … Secular power deemed to be ancestrally conferred is, as it were, sacralised by age in the life cycle, as a strong man approaches ancestorhood.""

“Traditionally, Roti is further divided into 18 self-ruling domains called nusak. Each domain is governed by its own Lord who, together with the lords of the various clans that make up the kingdom, presides at a law court and makes decisions based upon the customary usage of his domain. Although borders have always been disputed, it is clear from information in the Dutch archives that most of these domains have existed as independent states for over 300 years.” (Fox, 1968, p 7)

“Nusa(k), the word which I translate as 'domain’ in most contexts, has a number of interrelated meanings. First, the word can mean ‘island’ … Secondly, the word can refer to the independent political subdivisions of the island, the states which I describe as 'domains' … Another use of the word nusak, occurs in the expression, nusak lain, which is commonly shortened to simply nusak … Nusak lain, ‘high nusak’, is literally as well as figuratively the high point or centre of a domain. Within each domain, the nusak-lain is the village in which the Lord of a domain has his principal residence … Although Termanu is somewhat unusual in the extent of its former [121] fortifications, several of the nusak-lain in other domains are situated in positions, often on hill tops, that could be secured against attack. Other nusak-lain were moved to more accessible areas during the peace of the Dutch period.

“The nusak lain is the seat of a Lord’s court. This court is also called nusak and is usually held each week in the courtyard of the house of the Lord. The court is the centre of Rotinese political life and the chief duty of a lord with his councillors is to hear law cases (dedeä nusak) and to act as judge over his realm ... [122] ... The nusak, as court, is presided over by a Lord (manek), a lord-fetor (mane-fetor, or simply fetor), and by the lords of the clans that make up the domain. Among the clan lords is the lord who holds the title of ‘Head of the Earth’ (dae langak) and another lord who holds the somewhat obscure position of ‘Lord of the Knife’ (mane dope). In addition to these lords the court may be attended by the nobles (mane-ana) of the Lord’s lineage or clan and by the lesser nobles (sometimes called mane-feto-ana) of the fetor lineage of clan. Finally, there are always elders (tou-lasi-kala) who attend court and participate in the discussion on questions of customary usage (hadak) ... The court is thus representative of the entire domain.” (Fox, 1968, pp 120-122)",fox-1968[120-187]

‘The Corporate Communities (Haradjaon)’ (Vergouwen, 1964, pp. 105-136)

The Toba Batak lived in villages (huta), more than one of which formed a ‘tribal group’ (marga, though this term was also used for larger and smaller units):

""It is comparatively simple to describe the main features of the smallest of the Batak corporate groups, the village; and the highest, the tribal group. Below the village there is only the hamlet; above the tribal group there is only the Batak people as such. It is what lies between these two extremes that presents the difficulty."" (Vergouwen, 1964, p. 105)

Each village had a chief who among other things administered justice, but there was no formal leadership at the tribal group level:

""The authority in the village is usually the village head who is known by various titles: radja huta being the most usual one … It is he who is charged with the management of the village and the maintenance of law and custom, order and discipline. He is the patrilineal descendant of the founder of the village who was the first radja huta. This office, if possible, is passed from father to son, or to an uaris. Formerly a village chief was required to have more qualities than at present now that peace prevails. The village head's administration is as diverse as are the aspects of village life. He is responsible for the maintenance of the village square and the walls; he regulates the alignment of the houses and controls the lands of the village. He can decide whether a small garden must be given up in order to make room for a house or whether it can remain; he guides the legal conduct of his dependents and stands by them if they have to make a claim against anyone, or in the event of their creditors making too many difficulties for them. He conducts [116] their betrothal deliberations when their children marry. He represents the interests of his village and of his lineage where there is involvement with the outside world. And, though he has been pushed into the background in recent years, he is still the authority in the village who executes the orders of the higher authority. Formerly he was responsible for the administration of justice also ... The inhabitants of the village must accept his leadership and be guided by him and as proof of this they must honour him in such transactions as marriages, the sale of cattle, alienation of land, etc., with their gifts of homage, upa radja. He, on his side, usually consults his elder subordinates, na tua-tua or pangintuai, from the foremost of whom, the namora boru, the most important man of the in-dwelling marga, he receives regular support. This is especially the case when the matter relates to a dispute between him and members of his own lineage. Nevertheless, he has the last word. And if he has to assert his chiefly authority by force in order to ensure that his orders are observed, he does so. He is the government and police in one, and in olden times he sometimes had a block standing near his house so that he could place under restraint an inhabitant who would not submit with good grace to his orders. Naturally only a powerful figure who was head and shoulders above the villagers and whose words would not be taken lightly could make a successful village head whose authority would be felt."" (Vergouwen, 1964, pp. 115-116)

The tribal group:

""It is somewhat more difficult to present such a clear picture of the tribal group for it can cover whole valleys, large tracts of lowland and plateau, extensive mountain regions, or, half the island of Samosir in Lake Toba. The difficulty is, however, lessened a little because the boundaries between the tribal areas were clearly defined and permanently established when the contending tribal groups made peace after a war. Thus it is possible to show the individual tribal areas on a map. Such boundaries were not so necessary among the marga , marga branches and lineages, or for the groupings into which they so often united to form a more or less well-defined community. Therefore boundaries within the tribal group's area were frequently not defined, for though fighting was indeed frequent within a tribal group itself, when one faction might capture the hula of another, or some people might be driven from the place in which they lived, the contestants nevertheless belonged to one larger group and if a neighbouring group threatened to invade their territory they had to combine ... [107] ... The tribal group has only one characteristic of a corporate group: its own territory. 

“With regard to centralised authority, the Toba Batak preferred in the Pidari time to live in small convenient units consisting of some hundreds of people, at most a thousand, whose interests were confined to their own affairs … The tribal group can be considered in a sense as a unit: its members have a feeling of belonging together; they are of the same blood; and they have sprung from one ancestral village where a common guardian spirit is often honoured at ceremonies to which come members of the group living elsewhere. In the past its members sometimes arranged large communal offering-feasts. They feel that their security and welfare are best promoted by living together in one tribal area and by remaining together within its confines."" (Vergouwen, 1964, pp. 106-107)

The largest-scale ceremonies appear to have taken place at the level of the ‘tribal group’. Sometimes this coincided with a bius (‘sacrificial community’), but sometimes not. In part of the Toba Batak area, these ceremonies were managed by figures called parbaringan ‘priests of the bius feasts’, who were representatives of a figure called the Singamangaradja, whose influence appears to have transcended any one tribal group or bius. Elsewhere the parbaringan were less influential, and large-scale ceremonies were performed by figures called datu as well as the ‘principal chiefs of the tribal group’: 

“In the ceremony just described the great ancestor is accorded the respect that is his due. But, greater honour still was given to the sumangot if his line had grown to a great marga or tribal group. (Here one must speak in the past tense since Christianity has spread everywhere.) He was then elevated to the highest rank of spirits approaching the status of the gods ; he became the sombaon = he who is revered. Formerly this elevation took place at a great sacrificial ceremony that was specially arranged for the purpose, the santi rea, at which all his descendants and their affines assembled. Henceforth the sombaon would dwell in a holy place, on the summit of a mountain, in a primeval forest, or in a great river. In the Nai Rasaon group, for instance, the dwelling place of the spirit of the tribal ancestor is the Simanukmanuk mountain range that separates Uluan from the East Coast. The sombaon was always invoked at all important religious ceremonies as the principal [72] and most powerful of all the spirits of the patrilineal community. As a rule, his veneration took place at a place permanently assigned for the purpose: sometimes it was the market place of the whole community, sometimes it was elsewhere. The principal chiefs of the lineage met and made the necessary arrangements ... [73] ... The sacrificial feast that was arranged by the bius, or bus ('was' because the Dutch Government forbade these ceremonies many years ago) showed great conformity in its aims and forms with the big sombaon offering-ceremonies. The bius was distinguished from the latter in that it did not embrace a genealogically pure group of agnates (to whose feasts the affines and the chiefs of the neighbourhood were invited as guests), but a larger or smaller geographical area and all its inhabitants. Nevertheless, the genealogical divisions of the groups living within that area were not lost sight of … The bius and its cult had the least significance in areas where the marga, in occupying their ancestral territory, continued to live together as a whole with their separate branches and lineages, each marga having [74] its own corner of the territory. These marga, apart from dispersals, there formed genealogically as well as geographically well-rounded kinship groups. Each could conduct its own hordja, feasts, as occasion demanded for its own territory and if they united, they still always formed a higher group of patrilineally linked kinsmen in one area. Only if, for example, an epidemic ravaged the entire ancestral area or if drought threatened the fields of the inhabitants, would there be recourse to a general assembly of the inhabitants of the very large territory which embraced the tribal group as well as its in-dwelling groups and enclaves. The bius connection there did not have more far-reaching consequences than those resulting from the periodical sacrificial-feasts … In other regions, however, such as Samosir and Uluan, where the marga did not so often occupy their own homogeneous area but where, on the contrary, their divisions were usually dispersed over the whole of the tribal area in large or small groups, the formation of religious groups had acquired a secular significance too … Thus bius were formed which had a mixed religious and secular character. Each bius usually comprised a not too large geographical area and formed a political community of a couple of thousand people in [75] which a common feeling of solidarity outside the sphere of the sacrificial feasts proper had also developed. The objects of veneration in these bius were generally the ancestor common to all, the sombaon, as well as the gods and the nature spirits, and all the forefathers who had lived previously, the ompu sidjolo-djolo tubu, And there was a tendency to gather up these 'small' bius into a very large one which embraced the whole tribal group, or a very large part of it, with the sole object of celebrating the very large and communal sacrificial-ceremonies; for example, the bius 'Hariara maranak' for the whole of South Samosir, or the biu s 'O nan na godang' for the whole of South Uluan and 'Pansur na pitu' for North Uluan.

""It is worthy of note that in areas where the bius acquired this political character paganism has held out the longest. This is not attributable to the fact that worldly and spiritual power were under one control because this has not been the case, except in one or two areas, and then only temporarily. In part it can be ascribed to the influence of Singamangaradja whose most active representatives were always the parbaringin, the priests of the bius feasts. This applied only in the Sumba territory around the south-westerly parts of Lake Toba and not to the Lontung territory of Samosir and its environs where Singamangaradja met nothing but opposition. However, in these Lontung territories, the extensive organisation of officials which the bius brought into existence, and who conducted the more or less important rituals in the offering ceremonies, was also a powerful stronghold of paganism ... The parbaringin-organisation has become the carrier of pagan concepts. In the region where it is operative it almost entirely controls the regular worship and the agricultural ceremonies connected with it, and it has a powerful hold on the thoughts of the ordinary man such as is not to be found elsewhere. Such an organisation does not exist in the south of the Toba Country where the periodical bius feasts were directed by the principal chiefs of the tribal group. The datu co-operated where necessary and the paung na opat, as the representatives of Singamangaradja were sometimes called there, took part, but they remained in the background ... But in areas where the bius was a powerful institution the parbaringin were important people. It was the secular chiefs who decided to hold a bius ceremony, but in most of the [76] bius it was the parbaringin-organisation, which could be very extensive, that almost completely controlled the procedure of the ceremony."" (Vergouwen, 1964, pp. 72-76)

Vergouwen mentions three specifically religious specialists in the chapter of Toba Batak religion: the datu, parbaringin, and Singamangaradja, as well as mentioning that 'secular chiefs' played a religious role in that they were believed to be supernaturally powerful and could decide when to hold religious ceremonies:

""Though the tondi-potential is present in everybody, its supernatural force is neither apparent to everybody nor conspicuously active until a man displays particular qualities. Then its existence comes to light. A man who becomes wealthy, one who has a host of sons and daughters and grandsons, a man who carries on authoritatively the chieftaincy obtained by his forefathers, a courageous man, an eloquent man, all bear witness that their tondi has abundant power of which these desired qualities are a manifestation and, as a result, they have their share of courage, wealth, temporal power, etc., the sahala habeguon, hamoraon, haradjaon, etc. Of particular note are the 'potent ones', people like the datu or the parbaringin: they have been specially initiated into the secrets of magico-religious practices, they know how to arouse this power and how to make it efficacious. For this reason their supernatural power is very potent. This attribute was most marked in the supreme magician, Singamangaradja, who had complete control over these forces and knew how to direct them. The influential chiefs also display it to a remarkable degree. All who exhibit a particular 'power' are always honoured and respected by people as those deserving of respect, na sangap. Honour and respect, hasangapon, are the desirable results of possessing sahala."" (Vergouwen, 1964, p. 83)",vergouwen-1964[67-136]

18889,kwaraae,85,0,151-0,"Tricky. The principal leaders in Kwara’ae society were fataabu, usually translated ‘priest’ but sometimes ‘chief’. There were also ‘land leaders’ (etaeta), a status that was to some extent shared by all patrilineal descendants of a founding ancestor, but was more particularly vested in the senior male of the senior line. The positions of ‘priest’ and ‘land leader’ ‘ideally’ coincided. Exactly what the land leader did is not quite clear, but the role seems to have involved ‘management’ of the land of a local clan and acting as a ‘representative’ of that local clan. It appears to have been possible for a priest to act as land leader without actually being the acknowledged land leader, which suggests that the rights and duties of this role were not strictly vested in the office of either ‘priest’ or ‘land leader’.  

While the religious functions of some priests clearly went beyond the local community, this does not appear to have been the case for the role of land leader. Priests are also described as engaging in ‘redistribution’ through the sacrificial system. 

The priest (fataābu) whom the ancestors chose to mediate between them and the living was ideally the firstborn man of the senior line, so that the list of principal ancestors through which the clan traced its descent would often be conceived as a list of successive priests who were also the leaders for the land. (Burt, 1994, p. 27)

""The priest’s congregation and sphere of influence centred on his local clan group of fathers, brothers and sons and their families … Even if the priest was not also the most senior by descent and hence technically leader for the land, he would be the main authority on the genealogies demonstrating this leadership, which he had to recite during sacrifices to the ancestors concerned. Historical accounts and present opinion … both confirm that priests acted as land leaders and representatives of their local clans. In the 1960s Ramo’itolo of Latea gave a memorable demonstration of this role in several land disputes with neigbours of other clans.

""[68] But the priest’s essential duty and the source of his authority was to mediate with the ghosts, invoking their support and protection and making good offences against them … In fulfilling his responsibilities, he acted as the moral guardian of his people, ensuring that they treated the ghosts and each other as tabu and led lives which were righteous … and ‘clean’ … Sickness and calamity could result not only from offences against the ghosts themselves, but also from conflict among their dependants, such as quarrels or killings, sexual improprieties, incest and improper marriages. As the Christian preacher Didi’imae puts it, a priest was ‘like a big pastor’ … He was expected to demonstrate in his own life the values which distinguished an ‘important man’, living quietly and humbly, staying at home at prospering by working hard on his gardens, raising pigs and acquiring shell money with which to help others. Indeed some say that priests were always ‘important men’, even though ‘important men’ were not always priests. 

""As ‘important men’, priests contributed to exchanges of wealth and feasting through the sacrificial system, receiving on behalf of the ghosts both pigs and shell money offerings used to buy pigs, which were shared with other adult men in sacrificial meals and festivals. Sacrifices to ancestors also brought together their dependants within the local clan and beyond. When people were asked for pigs by ancestors from whom they were ‘born of women’, the sacrifice reaffirmed relationships with uncles and cousins in other clans, and claims to their clan lands. When they sent pigs ‘up’ to the ancient ancestors of their own clan at the shrines they derived from generations ago, they joined a wider congregation of local clans under the leadership of a priest of the senior line. The priests in charge of the ancient shrines of dispersed clans … had special opportunities for leadership through the hierarchical descent system."" (Burt, 1994, pp. 67-69)

""In describing priests as the true ‘important men’ of the past, Kwara’ae are voicing the ideal, which many hold as Christians, that society should be governed by spiritual rather than by secular authority, making the point that the two were inseparable in Kwara’ae traditional society. There may well be good reason to follow the Kwara’ae usage and call their priests ‘chiefs’, both to acknowledge ‘prevailing conceptions of chiefly leadership’ … and to recognise that they were engaged in what Sahlins calls ‘chiefly redistribution’ through the sacrificial system."" (Burt, 1994, p. 76)

Other leaders also existed, but appear not to have occupied defined offices, with the possible exception of the ‘official warrior’ (ramo to’ofu):

""Certain trained warriors (ramo to’ofu) were authorised by their community to enforce tabu, leading organised raids and assassinating appropriate victims to uphold the ‘law’, obtain restitution or collect rewards. For some clans this role is said to have been inherited, in a different line of descent to the senior priest. But unlike priests, official warriors were not essential to community life. Most men had to be prepared to fight on occasion and the title ‘warrior’ was probably applied loosely to any man who gained a reputation as a successful fighter … Quite how important warriors were as political leaders is difficult to say. The Kwara’ae view today is that they had little authority, for despite the wealth they obtained by collecting rewards, killing prevented them from gaining the popularity and prestige of an ‘important man’. But the authority of priests depended partly on the violent deeds of warriors to enforce the rules of tabu, as warriors depended on priests and ghosts to empower and authorise their deeds … But Kwara’ae share with other Malaitans the ideal of a tripartite leadership in which the roles of priest and warrior are complemented by wealthy feastgivers or ‘important men’ of the Melanesian ‘big man’ type, represent three interdependent spheres of political activity. Political power depended on the economic obligations to senior men which bound communities together but it was backed by the sanction of violence and supported by the spiritual power of [75] ghosts. The leadership of priests, warriors, and ‘important men’ has been documented by various writers for most other language areas of Malaita from Kwaio northwards (Ivens 1930, Hogbin 1939, Russell 1950, Ross 1973, 1978a, all cited in Keesing 1985). These descriptions often have a tendency to see the titles of leaders as definitions of roles or even formal offices, reflecting perhaps a Western expectation that leadership be specialised and institutionalised … In Kwara’ae priests are said to have been all these things too. But although priests could be said to hold formal office, ‘important man’ (ngwae ‘inoto’a, ngawae lalifu) was more a descriptive title, as ‘warrior’ probably was in many cases too.""

Hicks mentions two three types of religious specialist: priests, rainmakers, and shamans. No indication that any of these specialists also held secular power. 

""The priest is an office-holder who usually inherits his posi- [43] tion from a male in the paternal line and carries our public sacrifices on behalf of the suku community as a whole ... The priest also serves as guardian of any ritual house (uma lulik) that the suku or descent group may own ... A priest traditionally exercised an important political duty during the wars that occurred between kingdoms before the Portuguese pacification. At the ritual house owned by the suku he would administer a blessing to the warriors prior to their departure on a raid … Another figure involved in war rituals was the rainmaker. One of the rainmaker’s functions was to accompany the warriors to the vicinity of the enemy where he would then extract lime from his sacred lime container, and with the white powder in the palm of his left hand, he would blow it in the general direction where the enemy troops were thought to lurk, thereby rendering his own warriors invisible … The Timorese shaman is the local version of a magico-religious functionary known throughout much of the eastern archipelago as the dukun, whose position, unlike that of priest, is not inherited nor is it an office in the sense that it has an existence independent of its incumbent ... [44] ... Like the witch, the shaman transcends both the profane world and the sacred domain, but in contrast to the rainmaker and priest, the shaman's power foes not derive from succeeding in patrilineal succession from his or her father, but rather through allegedly commanding this talent from prediction and interpretation ... and having the capacity to convince clients he or she has either cured them or appreciably ameliorated their ills.""

The ‘tribe’ comprises a single ritual group, wherein branch villages observe the same rituals and taboos as the head village, and wherein the ‘tribal’ chieftain is both secular and religious leader. The senior village men's house serves a combined administrative, military, and ritual center for the entire complex. The above account is given added historical depth by Kojima, who describes what appear to have been river drainage districts or domains, each controlled by a hereditary priest-chief (peonshi), who might at the same time function as war leader (ijomu) ...

Except on Ua Pou, political organization did not extended beyond the 'tribe':

“It has been pointed out that in some of the large valleys there were single great tribes with subdivisions, while in other places there was a number of unrelated tribes; that, beyond certain loose alliances there was no unity between different sections of islands and different valleys, and even that there was warfare within single valleys between related tribes. In other words, political organization in the Marquesas never went beyond the tribal stage.

“Every tribe had its chief. When some of the great tribes were subdivided, the subdivisions had each its own chief, who was entirely independent; in other tribes the chiefs of the subtribes were under the authority of the chief of the larger group ... 
It has already been pointed out that it was only on the island of Ua Pou that there was any approach to political unity on one island through dominance by a single chief: in other words, that this was the only island which had what might properly be called a king. It is my opinion, however, that it is unnecessary to dignify any chief in the Marquesas by the title, 'king,' for the political organization was always of the very simplest order, and the relationship of the haka-iki and his people was always that of a chief to his fellow-tribesmen, never approaching that of a king to subjects."" (Handy, 1923, p. 35)

Chiefs lacked any active role in 'tribal worship':

""While the chief played no active rôle in the tribal ritual, he had what may be called a very important passive rôle. The concept of the association of human procreating power with generation, plenty, power, and so on, in nature, was fundamental in the native philosophy. The chief, as the living head of the tribal stock, represented the embodiment of this power for his tribe. It is natural, therefore, to find that in a chant obtained at Pua Ma'u, which was used in fishing, in connection with circumcision, and for other purposes, a number of esoteric words as elements in the charm have direct reference to the genitals of the chief. Another evidence of the way in which the chief embodied the spiritual power of the tribal, ancestral stock for his people is to be noted in the use of the skulls of chiefs in connection with certain rites, such as fishing. The same thing is shown again by the violent mourning in which the whole tribe participated on the death of their chief."" (Handy, 1923, p. 53)

""One thing which prevented chiefs of the Marquesas from assuming such arbitrary power as was held by those of Tahiti and Hawaii was the fact that in the Marquesas chiefs were invested with neither the sacredness nor the religious prestige that would support such authority. It is [55] evident that the inspirational priest (tau'a) was usually a member of the same family as the chief, but that the functions of the two were always entirely distinct. The chief had no important religious function in tribal ceremonial and no religious authority, except that indirectly derived through the tau'a."" (Handy, 1923, pp. 54-55)

‘Priests’ (Handy, 1923, pp. 223-230)

Handy's description suggests that religious organization, like political organization, does not as a rule appear to have extended beyond the tribe:

“The tribal inspirational priest was called tau'a, tau'a nui, or sometimes atua, which means literally god. The tau'a, who filled the rôle of tribal inspirational priests, must be distinguished from those of less prominence, called by the same name, who were private practitioners. Tau'a was a term which referred to all persons who were subject to possession by spirits or gods.

“After the tribal inspirational priest, the next in importance in tribal worship was the ceremonial priest, tuhuna o'ono (tuhika o'oko), who may be characterized also as the tribal bard and director of ritual, since it was he who led, and at times sang alone, the sacred chants in rites. He was also the teacher of chants and legends.

“Moa, u'u, or taputoho were men who were the guardians and assistants of the inspirational priest and consecrated to the work of serving as assistants in ceremonial. Tauoha, veveahu, or tauahi were servants of the inspirational priest.

“Tuhuna as a class, including the ‘old men’ who were masters of different professions, constituted a body that furnished the choirs which intoned the sacred chants during the ceremonials in the sacred places and on the feast places. Each of the above classes of religious functionaries will be discussed separately. Each tribal temple of importance had one inspirational priest, several ceremonial priests, and a considerable number of assistants.” (Handy, 1923, p. 223)

However, according to Thomas (1990), some tau'a were recognized over much larger areas than any chief:

""The importance of tau'a is underlined by the fact that, while evidence for any supralocal authority in the early contact period (except on 'Ua Pou) is lacking, the potency of some tau'a was clearly recognized in more than one valley: that of Tamapuameini was acknowledged over a whole island. There thus seems to have been a crude difference between the renown of certain shamans and that of any chief."" (Thomas, 1990, p 36)

Handy claims that chiefs outranked priests, but based on Thomas' comment that the power of tau'a often outstripped that of chiefs, I (OS) do not accept this.

""The order of society within the tribe may be graded according to function. First in prominence and prestige were the chiefs and chiefesses. Next in importance were the tribal inspirational priests, the tau'a—also spoken of as etua (god), because the individual was actually identified in the mind of the native with the god who was supposed to inspire him. Almost, but not quite, equal in rank and importance to the tau'a was the ceremonial priest (tuhuna o'ono, tuhuka o'oko), who recited and directed chants and ritual in ceremonies. Grading down from the tuhuna o'ono were the many other experts (tuhuna) skilled in other professions. Moa, temple assistants of the tau'a, ranked perhaps after the tuhuna o'ono along with the superior tuhuna. The toa, war leaders, ranked in civil affairs next to the chiefs themselves; but in general, in matters of tribal activity, in connection with which ritual and revelation from the tribal god were so important, they were in the actual social order of less importance than the tau'a and the tuhuna o'ono. The people as a whole were known as mata-ei-nana, which may best be translated as 'the people' and is also the word generally used for tribe. Included under this heading were all those not functioning in one or another of the capacities just mentioned: fighters, planters, fishermen (ava-ika), servants of the chiefs, assistants of tuhuna, the young libertines called ka'ioi, women in general whose activity was limited to the household industries, children, and old people. The arrangement, or grouping, of people at great festivals gives the best idea of the natural social order. The visiting chiefs sat on a special platform in front of the local chief's house; warriors and professionals sat together on another special platform; women and children, on another; and the inspirational priest with his assistants and the ceremonial priest were together at the sacred place attached to the feast place."" (Handy, 1923, p. 36)

Thomas describes religious and political authority in the Marquesas as 'radically disconnected':

""A critical difference emerges between the situation in the Marquesas and the construct which provided for ritual masters or priest-chiefs. It is emphasised from the earliest sources that Marquesan religious action was the province of ‘priests’, or in fact was divided between two entirely distinct classes of religious specialists: tuhuna o’ono and tau’a."" (Thomas, 1990, p. 34)

""Both chiefs and tau’a were clearly and radically disconnected from central elements of an integrative chiefly role. The essential element of chiefly status appears to have been the fact that chiefs were particularly tapu by reason of their privileged and unique proximity to gods through the senior line of chiefly ancestors. This tapu character required their being separated in various ways from the rest of the population … What distinguished the chief therefore had no enabling element: it related above all to a state, rather than special or unique capacities. In the more typical form of chieftainship, the state (of sanctity) and the capacities (for ritual efficacy) went together; in the Marquesan case the latter were associated rather with the shamans. Perhaps, then, an observation made about a particular Fijian chiefly family by Ratu Deve Toganivalu could well have been applied to many Marquesan haka’iki: ‘now they are nobles in the centre of the village, but do not have the decision in anything’.""

'Ritualism: 1965-66' (Wallace, 2013, pp. 97-104)

The only religious specialists mentioned are mediums called mabayen if male, or makamong if female:

""Since most 'sicknesses' and 'hurts' were caused by malevolent spirits, or because a person broke a taboo or disregarded an omen, the way to avoid death or prolonged illness was to turn to a Ga’dang ritual specialist. Mediums, both male and female, were usually elderly, and addressed with terms of respect meaning 'old man' and 'old woman'. As previously mentioned, a male medium was a mabayen and female medium was a makamong. While there were both male and female mediums, the consensus was that women mediums had greater powers of divination and were more able to act as go-betweens in the spiritual world (Wallace 1975). Male mediums specialized in recounting myths and in singing and chanting ritual songs.

""Mediums among the Ga'dang, like those in most other hill groups of the Cordillera Central, were part time specialists ... [97] ... They had the same economic and social responsibilities as any other members of society. Because of their special capabilities, however, they had an elevated status in Ga’dang society. They were rewarded well for their services and were on demand throughout much of the year ... Mediums, especially women, served as effective go-betweens for humans and the spirits and deities that wandered between the kalekay and duafa of the ilosa."" (Wallace, 2013, pp 96-97)

These mediums are described as 'officiating' at various ceremonies, but all these ceremonies were household level. 

Lebar notes:

""Agricultural, life cycle, and curing rites are on the whole household affairs; only headhunting ceremonies in the past involved the entire community."" (Lebar, 1975, p. 102)",2013wallace[95-104];lebar1975[102]
21213,trobriand-islands,85,1,151-1,"‘The natives of the Trobriand Islands’ (Malinowski, 1922, pp. 49-78)

In his fairly detailed overview of Trobriand society, Malinowski (1922) mentions two kinds of ritual specialist: the garden magician and the sorcerer.

The garden magician:

""Among the forces and beliefs which bear upon and regulate garden work, perhaps magic is the most important. It is a department of its own, and the garden magician, next to the chief and the sorcerer, is the most important personage of the village. The position is hereditary , and, in each village, a special system magic is handed on in the female line from one generation to another. I have called it a system , because the magician has to perform a series of rites and spells over the garden, which run parallel with the labour, and which, in fact, initiate each stage of the work and each new development of the plant life. Even before any gardening is begun at all, the magician has to consecrate the site with a big ceremonial performance in which all the men of the village take part. This ceremony officially opens the season's gardening, and only after it is performed do the villagers begin to cut the scrub on their plots. Then, in a series of rites, the magician inaugurates successively all the various stages which follow one another--the burning of the scrub, the clearing, the planting, the weeding and the harvesting."" (Malinowski, 1922, p 59)

""Again, within each district, the several village communities have each a great deal of independence. A village community is represented by a headman, its members make their gardens in one block and under the guidance of their own garden magician; they carry on their own feasts and ceremonial arrangements, mourn their dead in common, and perform, in remembrance of their departed ones, an endless series of food distributions. In all big affairs, whether of the district or of the tribe, members of a village community keep together, and act in one group."" (Malinowski, 1922, p 70)

The sorcerer:

""Not only does the chief--by which word I shall designate a headman of rank--possess a high degree of authority within his own village, but his sphere of influence extends far beyond it . A number of villages are tributary to him, and in several respects subject to his authority. In case of war, they are his allies, and have to foregather in his village. When he needs men to perform some task, he can send to his subject villages, and they will supply him with workers. In all big festivities the villages of his district will join, and the chief will act as master of ceremonies … One point in connection with the chief's authority deserves special mention. Power implies not only the possibility of rewarding, but also the means of punishing. This in the Trobriands is as a rule done indirectly, by means of sorcery. The chief has the best sorcerers of the district always at his beck and call. Of course he also has to reward them when they do him a service. If anyone offends him, or trespasses upon his authority, the chief summons the sorcerer, and orders that the culprit shall die by black magic. And here the chief is powerfully helped in achieving his end by the fact that he can do this openly, so that everybody, and the victim himself knows that a sorcerer is after him."" (Malinowski, 1922, pp 63-64)

""By far the most prevalent form of black magic, is that of the bwaga'u , that is the black sorcerer, of whom there are a number in each district. Usually even in each village there are one or two men more or less dreaded as bwaga'u."" (Malinowski, 1922, p 73)

Based on the excerpts above, the role of garden magician was clearly an office at the village level. Sorcery appears to have been a profession rather than an office, and in any case does not appear to have been linked to any defined group. 

Elsewhere, Malinowski makes it clear that the position of towosi (garden magician) was the prerogative of the ‘chief’, though often he delegated it to a close relative. 

""The towosi or garden magician is an hereditary official of every village community. As a matter of fact, the position of towosi coincides with that of the Chief or the head-man, if not in identity of person, at least in the principle of lineage. In native mythology and legal theory, it is always the head of the kinship group owning a village who is the garden magician. This man, however, frequently delegates his duties to his younger brother, his matrilineal nephew, or his son. Such handing over of the office of garden magician was especially frequent in the lineage of the paramount chiefs of Omarakana, on whom the duties of charming the gardens weighed too heavily.""

“The missionaries interpreted the term ere as meaning ‘priest’, whereas it literally means ‘expert or skilful person’ (for example ere huhuo= an expert of oration; ere hoho= an expert in telling stories or genealogies or myths in a very poetic way; ere maena = an expert in leading a traditional dance called maena; ere nadu= a priest of the primal religion, or an expert who has skill in leading rites related to adu; ere börö nadu= the highest priest and lawmaker), who served in the region of Börö Nadu ... How did a person become an ere? It began with a person’s being possessed by a spirit. This person would then leave the banua and stay in the wilderness for some time. Out there, he or she would have visions, experiencing hunger and thirst ... The candidate ere, having returned to the village, was required to sacrifice to the adu zatua and to take lessons from a more senior and experienced ere … After having [27] completed this phase successfully, he or she would visit various villages. Whenever leaving a village, he or she would take a young branch of a tree, split it and walk through it, thereby leaving behind the evil spirits of that village. If the candidate completed this tour without harm, he or she had passed the examination and was considered to be a qualified ere.” (Hummell & Telaumbanua, 2007, pp. 26-27)

""The feast of reconciliation, celebrated in Teluk Dalam, i.e., in Maenamölo, was called famatö harimao ... This feast was celebrated by a federation of several banua, called öri, once every seven years. Its purpose was to renew, and to reformulate the law, and then to validate the law as thus renewed ... After seven days, coming from three different directions, the clans … would congregate in Ono Hondrö village. From here, carrying huge tiger statues ... they made a procession to the Jumali-Gomo River (near the village of Ono Hondrö). Upon their arrival, the ere or börö nadu would throw the images down into the river, where they would be shattered. This was the symbolic ritual of redemption for individuals and the community ...The next day, all the people would again gather in Hili Amaigila, which was considered to be the equivalent of Börö Nadu in Gomo, since it was the residence of the ere. Here a meeting ... was conducted, particularly by the adat chiefs, including the ere. During this meeting, they would inspect and if necessary adjust all the afore (a staff or rod for measuring pigs), the lauru (a tool to weigh rice), the saga (weights for weighing pork), the ondrakhata (tools for weighting gold), and fix/set the prices for all daily needs (e.g. rice, pigs, gold, etct), as well as discussing and agreeing upon things related to community concerns and customs.” (Hummell & Telaumbanua, 2007, p. 29)

“The climaxing ceremony is the börö n’adu ceremony, which reportedly takes place every seven or fourteen years. At this time several districts comprising a ceremonial group assemble in one place. The gathering place is the exact spot where the legendary figures descended from the upperworld to Nias and is marked by a sacred temple and cosmic tree. During the börö n’adu all activities as garden work cease and feuds are suspended for the duration of this ceremony. Two sacred priests conduct the ceremony which consists of the destruction of totemic symbols – gigantic figures of tigers and females carved in wood and placed on high platforms – by throwing these figures into the sacred river.” (Suzuki, 1958, p. 5)",hummel-telaumbanua2007[26-30];suzuki1958[5]

“It was the high priest who played the supreme role in religious ceremonies. It may be that the marae’s ‘owner,’ the king [i.e. tribal chief], was more important overall, but his role in religious ceremonies was purely passive, while the high priest, who mediated between king and deity, played a very active part in all religious events … But his activities were not confined within marae precincts; in other [secular] affairs as well he exercised immense influence, depending more or less on the character of the king (as is usually the case in such circumstances) … In fact, the high priest’s jurisdiction resembled that of a bishop. It [usually] extended over all the maraes located in the territory ruled by his sovereign chief; but there were exceptions to such parallel jurisdictions. In some cases, for example, a chief had two or more high priests in his domain; in other cases a high priest’s jurisdiction extended over two [independent] tribal domains. And finally, there were certain ‘international’ maraes served by the most renowned high priest thereabouts [regardless of tribal domain].” (de Bovis, 1909, as quoted in Oliver, 1974, p 869)

Scale of Maohi ‘tribes’:

“Next to the household itself, the smallest territorial unit in these Islands was what I called a neighbourhood, consisting of one or more households. Evidence was presented earlier of Maohi beliefs relating to autonomous neighbourhoods, and during the eras when these Islands were being populated there must have been many such. But as noted earlier, by the late Indigenous Era there appear to have been no autonomous territorial units, or tribes, simpler than that of Tetaha, which consisted of several neighbourhoods combined into at least two neighbourhood subunits … The simplest tribe larger than a single neighbourhood would have been one composed of two or more neighbourhoods differentiated only to the extent that the chief of one of them exercised final authority over all of them in events involving all of them …  Next in order of complexity was a tribe composed of two or more multineighbourhood units each with its own local chief but all subject to the ultimate authority of one among them. On Tahiti itself, during the era under study, this multi-multi-neighbourhood order of complexity seems to have been exemplified only by Fa’a’a (Tetaha, Te Fana I Ahurai … More complex still was a type of tribe composed of two or more multi-multi-neighbourhood units. On Tahiti one such unit was known as Te Porionu’u, made up of the multi-multineighbourhood units of Pare and Arue, before their overall chief Pomare I succeeded in extending his sway elsewhere … The native label fenua seems to have been applied to tribes of both the third and fourth orders of complexity; and if one follows Morrison’s usage, the major subdivisions of both would have been patu – although according to Bligh, pare and Arure were also known as the two mano of Porionu’u. But again, some writers apply the labels mata’eiana and va’a mata’eina’a to these territorial units and their inhabitants, respectively … A fifth order of complexity was the type of unit latterly exemplified on Tahiti by Teva i uta and Teva i tai. As we saw, Bligh called such units ‘grand divisions’ or ‘Princedoms,’ and Morrison referred to them as ‘alliances’ … During the five decades after 1767 these and other Tahitian territorial units were linked to one another in various shifting combinations, and in the end all Tahiti (along with Mo’orea) was united into a single, sixth-order unit.” (Oliver, 1974, pp 976-977)","oliver1974[869, 976-977]"

Naturally, this could involve any aspect of communal life or religion.

“The hierarchy of a Niasan community is as follows: At the top, there was a nobleman (balugu or si’ulu), and a chief (salawa in North, Central, East and West Nias), or a balö (zi’ulu) was the highest ruler in the community, above all other noble people in the community. This group of noble people itself was also divided into two categories: those who were involved in the government and those who were not. The [56] second group was ‘ordinary people’ (sato or sihönö), and the third group was made up of the slaves (sawuyu or harakana) ... The noble class (nga ‘ötö zalawa or si’ulu) was regarded as being similar to the gods, and the ordinary people (nga ‘ötö niha sato/sito ‘ölö were regarded as belonging to the lower world ... In the traditional Niasan society, the leader of a community was called salawa or balö zi’ulu, while at the level of the öri, the leader was called tuhenöri. F. Harefa writes ‘Salawa means ‘the highest’. He is called such because, in comparison with other people, he is highest in all respects. For example: in terms of tradition, he is the eldest; in terms of material wealth, he is rich; in terms of intelligence, he is the smartest, etc.’"" (Hummell & Telaumbanua, 2007, pp. 55-56)","hummel-telaumbanua2007[26-30, 55-56]"

21215,trobriand-islands,86,2,150-2,"‘V’ [Chieftainship] (Malinowski, 1922, pp. 62-69)

“Chieftainship in the Trobriands is the combination of two institutions: first, that of headmanship, or village authority; secondly, that of totemic clanship , that is the division of the community into classes or castes, each with a certain more or less definite rank.

“In every community in the Trobriands, there is one man who wields the greatest authority, though often this does not amount to very much. He is, in many cases, nothing more than the primus inter pares in a group of village elders, who deliberate on all important matters together, and arrive at a decision by common consent. It must not be forgotten that there is hardly ever much room for doubt or deliberation, as natives communally, as well as individually, never act except on traditional and conventional lines. This village headman is, as a rule, [63] therefore, not much more than a master of tribal ceremonies, and the main speaker within and without the tribe whenever one is needed.

“But the position of headman becomes much more than this, when he is a person of high rank, which is by no means always the case. In the Trobriands there exist four totemic clans, and each of these is divided into a number of smaller sub-clans, --which could also be called families or castes, for the members of each claim common descent from one ancestress, and each of them holds a certain, specified rank. These subclans have also a local character, because the original ancestress emerged from a hole in the ground, as a rule somewhere in the neighbourhood of their village community. There is not one sub-clan in the Trobriands whose members cannot indicate its original locality, where their group, in the form of the ancestress, first saw the light of the sun … The highest sub-clan is that of the Tabalu, belonging to the Malasi totem clan. To this sub-clan belongs the main chief of Kiriwina, To'uluwa, who resides in the village of Omarakana (see Plate II and Frontispiece). He is in the first place the headman of his own village, and in contrast to the headmen of low rank, he has quite a considerable amount of power. His high rank inspires everyone about him with the greatest and most genuine respect and awe, and the remnants of his power are still surprisingly large, even now, when white authorities, very foolishly and with fatal results, do their utmost to undermine his prestige and influence.

“Not only does the chief--by which word I shall designate a headman of rank--possess a high degree of authority within his own village, but his sphere of influence extends far beyond it . A number of villages are tributary to him, and in several respects subject to his authority. In case of war, they are his allies, and have to foregather in his village. When he needs men to perform some task, he can send to his subject villages, and they will supply him with workers. In all big festivities [64] the villages of his district will join, and the chief will act as master of ceremonies. Nevertheless, for all these services rendered to him he has to pay. He even has to pay for any tributes received out of his stores of wealth. Wealth, in the Trobriands, is the outward sign and the substance of power, and the means also of exercising it. But how does he acquire his wealth? And here we come to the main duty of the vassal villages to the chief. From each subject village, he takes a wife, whose family, according to the Trobriand law, has to supply him with large amounts of crops. This wife is always the sister or some relation of the headman of the subject village, and thus practically the whole community has to work for him. In olden days, the chief of Omarakana had up to as many as forty consorts, and received perhaps as much as thirty to fifty per cent. of all the garden produce of Kiriwina. Even now, when his wives number only sixteen, he has enormous storehouses, and they are full to the roof with yams every harvest time.
	
“With this supply, he is able to pay for the many services he requires, to furnish with food the participants in big feasts, in tribal gatherings or distant expeditions. Part of the food he uses to acquire objects of native wealth, or to pay for the making of them. In brief, through his privilege of practising polygamy, the chief is kept supplied with an abundance of wealth in food stuffs and in valuables, which he uses to maintain his high position; to organise tribal festivities and enterprises, and to pay, according to custom, for the many personal services to which he is entitled.

“One point in connection with the chief's authority deserves special mention. Power implies not only the possibility of rewarding, but also the means of punishing. This in the Trobriands is as a rule done indirectly, by means of sorcery. The chief has the best sorcerers of the district always at his beck and call. Of course he also has to reward them when they do him a service. If anyone offends him, or trespasses upon his authority, the chief summons the sorcerer, and orders that the culprit shall die by black magic. And here the chief is powerfully helped in achieving his end by the fact that he can do this openly, so that everybody, and the victim himself knows that a sorcerer is after him. As the natives are very deeply and genuinely afraid of sorcery, the feeling of being [65] hunted, of imagining themselves doomed, is in itself enough to doom them in reality. Only in extreme cases, does a chief inflict direct punishment on a culprit. He has one or two hereditary henchmen, whose duty it is to kill the man who has so deeply offended him, that actual death is the only sufficient punishment. As a matter of fact, very few cases of this are on record, and it is now, of course, entirely in abeyance.
“Thus the chief's position can be grasped only through the realisation of the high importance of wealth, of the necessity of paying for everything, even for services which are due to him, and which could not be withheld. Again, this wealth comes to the chief from his relations-in-law, and it is through his right to practise polygamy that he actually achieves his position, and exercises his power.

“Side by side with this rather complex mechanism of authority, the prestige of rank, the direct recognition of his personal superiority, give the chief an immense power, even outside his district. Except for the few of his own rank, no native in the Trobriands will remain erect when the great chief of Omarakana approaches, even in these days of tribal disintegration. Wherever he goes, he is considered as the most important person, is seated on a high platform, and treated with consideration.” (Malinowski, 1922, pp. 62-65)

“The most important chief is, as said, the one who resides in Omarakana and rules Kiriwina, agriculturally the richest and most important district. His family, or sub-clan, the Tabalu , are acknowledged to have by far the highest rank in all the Archipelago. Their fame is spread over the whole Kula district; the entire province of Kiriwina derives prestige from its chief, and its inhabitants also keep all his personal taboos, which is a duty but also a distinction. Next to the high chief, there resides in a village some two miles distant, a personage who, though in several respects his vassal, is also his main foe and rival, the headman of Kabwaku, and ruler of the province of Tilataula. The present holder of this title is an old rogue named Moliasi. From time to time, in the old days, war used to break out between the two provinces, each of which could muster some twelve villages for the fight ... The ruler of Tilataula has an intermediate rank, and outside his district he does not enjoy much prestige; but within it, he has a considerable amount of power, and a good [67] deal of wealth, in the shape of stored food and ceremonial articles. All the villages under his rule, have, of course, their own independent headman, who, being of low rank, have only a small degree of local authority.” (Malinowski, 1922, pp. 66-67)",malone2006[62-69]

Surrounding the nucleus were village households related to that core (see the ta-djaLan above), along with those non-related households residing on core land. This ritual unit, therefore, has traditionally coincided with the political unit of the chiefdom. In a few villages in western Paiwan territory, however, a chief from a household established through budding from an original chief's household occupied part of the original village land, but organized a separate ritual group with villagers who lived on, and who cultivated land given to the new chief. These would be communal rituals on a smaller scale, and this new group would join the original chief's ritual group for large-scale rituals (discussed in detail in the last part of this chapter) ... Communal rituals are led by chiefs as a couple, along with two priests, male and female, called parakalay. In a few villages, such as Su-Paiwan and Kapiyan, there were several appointed priests, male and female (see Kojima et al 1922: 54-55). The common way to appoint a priest was by selection of a proper person from among all villagers by the chief and the village elders, and then to ask the will of their ancestors' spirits through divination, whether this was a correct selec­tion. Only a few villages, such as Su-Paiwan and some southern villages, reported that such priests were appointed from amongst chiefly families (ibid: 55-57). Several shamannesses, all female, were reported for each village. They were called maLada in the western areas and puLigaw in eastern villages. Male priests were assigned to hunting rituals, and female priests were assigned to agricultural rituals in communal rituals. Shamannesses sometimes  assisted priests in communal rituals, but were mainly engaged in private rituals and in various kinds of divination. Both priests and shamannesses were not full-time specialists but were given some privileges and respect, par­ticularly in the case of priests."" (Matsukawa, 1989, pp 200-202). 

""Paiwan chiefs exercized political and ritual leadership as a married couple ... Sexual division of roles was clear: leadership in headhunting and hunting game animals under the male chief of a couple, and communal affairs of agriculture under the female chief of a couple was understood. Other administrative or judicial authority was bestowed on the chiefs as a couple.""  (Matzusawa, 1989, p 205)","matsuzawa1989[200-202, 205]"

17645,ami,85,2,151-2,"""Ami society appears to be characterized by what might be termed a dualistic power structure. Secular authority seems clearly based in the male age-grade system, with women expressly excluded from age-graders and men's houses (the educational and administrative centers of the village) and thus from political life. At the same time, it seems evident that ritual authority has its basis in the female-oriented matrilineage system, although here again it is the brothers of lineage women who actually function as priests. In retrospect, the age-grade system has the appearance of having been superimposed on an original kin-based society, with positions of leadership grounded in (largely) ritual status derived from the genealogical nearness to an original 'founding' line. The result has been a kind of split between secular and ritual leadership ... According to C. L. Chen (1965), political power in northern ... Ami villages is vested in a 'chiefs assembly', composed of men chosen from among the papuro'ai (lit.: 'one who speaks""), leaders or monitors of the mature age-grades. A man who seeks this office must be an eloquent speaker, skilled in ritual and hunting, and wealthy enough to sponsor a feast and display his wealth before all other papaur'ai. A speaker, elected by the chiefs' assembly is the 'high chief' in the village, although hunting, warfare and headhunting are the responsibility of another high chief , who is elected from among the warrior chiefs of the various age-grades. Other assemblies or councils (of elders, of all males, of all age-grade monitors) mitigate to some extent the power of the chief's assembly. A somewhat similar system of secular 'chiefs' (saparangau), leaders of proven ability chosen from the ranks of the more mature age-grades, is described by Chen and Coe (1954) for the central Ami village of Tavarong. Political power here is in the hands of these older men, who are seated at important ceremonies in order of their rank (Furuno 1945:285ff.) ... The situation in the central Ami village of Vataan, most fully described of all Ami villages, is apparently somewhat atypical. Here the village (niaroh) is divided into hamlets or sections (kuan), each with a headman and a representative (kakisowal, 'eloquent speaker'). From among the kakisowal are elected the members (komod) of a village council, administrators of fishing and hunting rights and other village-owned property. From among the council membership, in turn, there is chosen a 'high chief' (sapalungau), a genealogical/ritual specialist who sets the dates for major festivals and presides over meetings and ceremonies ... As summarized by by Liu et al. (1965:169-88, 265-167), leadership in Vataan is in the hands of a high chief, assisted by hamlet headmen and age-class leaders, with the high chief acting additionally in the capacity of a chief priest. This kind of political hierarchy, with its by-passing of the traditional rights of the kakitaan priestly families, has progessed farthest in Vataan - probably as a consequence of Taiwanese acculutrative pressures ...

“The structure of the Ami universe is at this time stated as a hierarchy in which each rank of seniority hands down precepts to be obeyed by the next lower rank … At the top level, for among the Ami the spiritual world is continuous with the material, are the sun goddess, the moon god, and maratau, the tulelary deity who instructed men in the order thing things on earth. With them are the tatakusan, the ancestral gods who are to be respected as elders and whose way of life is to be followed. Under these were the kakita:n, the priestly families who carried out the will of the gods in this world. The rest of the Ami were arranged by seniority into a system of age-grades, each with its chosen monitor, and each harkening to the instructions passed down from the next senior age-grade. Acting as intermediaries between the priests and the laity were the saparaŋau, leaders of proven ability selected from the ranks of the elder grades. This structure was annually affirmed symbolically in the irisiŋ, and it is clear that it was basically gerontocratic in nature, in that the real power was in the hands of old men.” (Chen & Coe, 1954, p 261)",lebar1975[120-121];chen-coe1954

“In contrast to many of the societies of eastern Indonesia, Tana 'Ai never had an indigenous
raja, nor did the Tana 'Ai domains constitute local secular states. The pattern of a diarchical division of power and authority between a secular ruler and a ritual authority, common to other eastern Indonesian societies, is reflected in a division by which women, as the heads of clans, exercise secular authority over domestic and horticultural matters and men, as the ritual specialists of the domain, exercise sacred authority, principally in the execution of ritual … When dealing with secular matters, men are conceived as acting as the delegates of their sisters and clan or lepo mothers … In Tana 'Ai, women rule within autonomous social units and men, in whom is vested authority for the conduct of the external affairs of the group, are the ‘glue’ that binds the confederation of diverse clans and houses into the larger domain.” (Lewis, 1993, p. 25)

19335,tokelau,85,1,151-1,"Sources are contradictory. According to Macgregor the offices of high chief and high priest were combined in the distant past, but had since been separated:

""The high chief of the Tokelau Islands was a patriarchal head. He had full authority over all the people and established their laws, which he enforced by his power to curse any one to death. He was also at one time priest to the supreme deity, Tui Tokelau, through whom he brought a plentiful supply of food, sufficient rain, and stormless weather to his people ... [51] ... Dr. Turner says that Tuitokelau was both king and priest. I was, however, informed that the king or ariki was not also vakatua or priest of the god. It seems probable that the two offices were originally combined in one person, but that afterwards as is now affirmed by the people of Fakaofo, the son of the ariki became king, but the son of his sister became priest ... [In a footnote Newell adds] As we have seen, this law of heredity with regard to the office of ariki does not now obtain on Fakaofo. I transcribe the exact words of the statement made to me about the offices of king and priest: 'O tamafafine na fai ma vakatua; o tamatane na fai ma ariki'—Daughters became priestesses; sons became chiefs.

""No evidence exists to indicate that women were ever priestesses. The translation of Newell's information should read, 'The children of a sister became priests; the sons of the father became chiefs,' which was the correct order of succession. The use of the terms ariki and vaka atua by the natives does not show which one held higher rank.

""From the change in mode of succession it seems probable that the offices of chief and high priest were divided. However, the dual division may have always existed until the appearance of Christian missionaries who stamped out the priesthood. When Newell came to Fakaofu, the office of high priest had already been abolished and he found only a secular high chief at the head of the native social order."" (Macgregor, 1937, pp. 50-51)

However, Huntsman and Hooper are emphatic that the high chief (aliki) was also the priest of Tui Tokelau, and provide a plausible explanation of how the misunderstanding that he was not a priest may have come about:

'Priests' (Huntsman & Hooper, 1996, pp. 158-159)

""It is clear from most sources that the aliki was the sole priest of the god Tui Tokelau. Turner (1861:526) states that 'the government is monarchical, and the king, Tui Tokelau is high priest as well'. This confuses the god with the aliki (perhaps understandably) but it does correctly describe the religious nature of the aliki office. This was certainly also the impression given to Stallworthy and Gill on their 1858 visit, when 'Lita [Likā] who is styled ariki [sic], or chief ... was described as le polo o le Atua, or priest of god'. Furthermore, there is the unequivocal local statement: ‘There were no taulāitu of the idol’, so it was only aliki who directed the refurnishing of the idol.

""In modern Tokelauan, as in Samoan, taula-aitu is commonly glossed as ‘priest’, the etymology of the term suggesting the notion of a connection ... with an aitu or spirit being. Although the Fakaofo manuscript makes no other reference to taula-aitu, Lister (1892:50) makes a clear distinction between the aliki and taula-aitu, whom he called 'priests', and who, he wrote, were 'chosen by the king and formed an ipper class in society'. Presumably (Lister is not explicit on this point) these 'priests' were concerned with the other, lesser gods to which he makes reference, but what their 'upper class' status might have been remains obscure in his account.

""Newell’s statement that ‘the son of the ‘ariki became king, but the son of his sister became priest’ (1895: 606) offers a possible explanation, particularly as he also gives ‘the exact words of the statement ... O tamafafine na fai ma vakatua, o tamatane na fai ma ariki.’ (Vaka-atua can be glossed as ‘priest’ in modern Tokelauan, though the term also carries the connotation of the individual as a vessel, or vaka, of the atua, or god.) Newell glosses this phrase, ‘Daughters became priestesses, sons became chiefs.’ This is ambiguous, a much more likely gloss being ‘The female [sororal] line supplied priests, the male [fraternal] line the aliki.’ If this were the case, the statement can be taken to mean that vaka-atua were chosen from among those who stood in a tamafafine relationship to the aliki. Newell's confusion derives from the term tamafafine, which can mean both 'daughter' and 'a male or female in the female line'.

""These ‘priests’ (either taula-aitu or vaka-atua) might possibly have been associated with the aliki in performance of his duties to Tui Tokelau. Alter- [159] natively, their duties may have been to one or more of the lesser gods or spirit beings which are recorded."" (Huntsman & Hooper, 1996, pp 158-159)

'Governance and faipule' (Huntsman & Hooper, 1996, pp. 159-161)

Ultimate political authority clearly lay with the aliki, though some of it may have been delegated to a kind of spokesman:

""It is clear from all the accounts of the US Exploring Expedition’s brief visit that Taupe, the aliki of the time, was the central figure in the island’s reception for Captain Hudson and his party. Taupe was ‘seated forward’ of the others ... he offered the island’s gifts and it was he who took charge of Hudson, after reluctantly allowing the foreigners to tour the village. He appears to have deferred to nobody else, and it was only he who is reported to have spoken. Much the same scene was re-enacted some twelve years later, in 1853, for a party from a visiting ship that was received by ‘His Majesty ... seated on a mat near the spot of our landing surrounded by his counsellors – dignified old men…’ On this occasion, though, the visitors ‘were conducted through the village by one of the dignitaries, very likely the Prime Minister, the others the meanwhile retaining their place on the shore.

""From that time on all of the visitors to the island perceived, and commented upon, a distinction between two offices – that of aliki or ‘king’, and another which is variously described as that of ‘prime minister’ or ‘chief counsellor’ or ‘civil chief’ ... [160] ... All these accounts testify to a division of roles on the island between Likā the aliki, who doubtless continued as the supreme sacred authority but did not speak on matters of civic concern, and Foliga, who was the magistrate and the main spokesman on civil matters. The antiquity of this role division is problematic, particularly in light of Taupe’s singular role in relation to Fakaofo’s 1841 visitors.

""If Taupe and his contemporaries did believe that the US Exploring Expedition had come from the sky, as Hale and others asserted, and were divinities of some sort, the aliki was the only proper person to confront them. Twelve years later, after all sorts of foreign incursions ... people would certainly have understood that such visitors were mere mortals, and the aliki could be left to concentrate on his spiritual business while some civil authority dealt with them. While this separation of sacred and civil spheres might have been an innovation, it seems more likely that it was an old and established division of authority which visitors, expecting a singular ‘king’, found remarkable. Or Foliga might have had some charisma which gave him prominence, and which led Likā to call upon him to speak for the island as a whole ... Whatever the explanation for Foliga’s considerable authority, there is other evidence indicating that there were fundamental changes made in the political structure at around the time of Taupe, which involved some diminution of what had presumably been more absolute aliki authority. (This transformation is related in Perez, 1977). Taupe himself, as the (presumably unwitting) ‘instrument of God’s profound and serious purpose’, instituted a council of ‘aliki and faipule’, thus giving some degree of conjoint authority in political affairs to those who were not of the aliki lineage. From that point on, the governance of Fakaofo was carried out in the following manner:

""'First of all, the Aliki (king) met with aliki of the Latupou and aliki of the Lafalala, and they decided what was to be done before they invited the group called Faipule to talk about the things agreed upon by the high aliki. At the end of their meeting they decided the day for a meeting of the whole village. The meeting of Aliki and Faipule was usually held at Hakavā.

""Meeting of the whole village. This meeting was usually held at the Malae of Fakafotu, the place for village meetings, where it was revealed what the Aliki of Fakaofo had decided should be done. Nobody of the village made any reply, or stated their opinion, but obeyed directly.' 

[161]

""This account makes no direct reference to a particular office embodying civil as distinct from religious authority. It is, however, plausible to assume that it was one of the ‘Faipule group’ who ‘revealed what the Aliki ... had decided should be done’ at village meetings, since that would conform with what was definitely the situation in the later nineteenth century when there were two distinct offices, aliki or ‘king’ and faipule or ‘lawmaker’, whose incumbents spoke for Fakaofo, as who on occasion signed their names as the joint authorities of island government ...""

'The functioning of the political community in Timor' (Schulte Nordholt, 1971, pp. 326-367)

Each Atoni princedom was 'ruled' by a figure called the atupas. His activities were primarily religious:

""In the discussion of the political system we shall see, however, how important the implications of these fundamental religious notions are for all aspects of life, and especially for the political life, where the raja is the mediator between the living and the dead and between the community of the living and the dead on the one hand and the forces of the hidden world on the other. He is the most important being, the apex of the hierarchical order, which is not only a political one, but [153] pervades the whole of the lasi meto. Lasi meto is a contracted form of lasi atoni pah meta - the words or affairs of the people of the dry land, that is, the words handed down by the ancestors, especially those laid down in the ritual. They are the things man does or ought to do. It is the Timorese definition of the Indonesian adat concept. The raja is the principal preserver of this divine order. He is responsible for the ritual performed at the presentation of the harvest gifts, when his great altar (tola naek) is used for sacrificing, and for the ritual accompanying war. The latter takes place in the shrine (ume le'u) adjoining his palace. Thus he is also the religious centre of his realm."" (Schulte Nordholt, 1971, pp 152-153)

""Parallel with this we also found a gradual transition from a low to a high degree of femininity in the nature of the rulership … [373] … Hence in the east of the Atoni area the feminine, immobile nature of the ruler's function is especially emphasized, and the ruler is therefore regarded first and foremost as the custodian of the sacred objects who is responsible for the ritual … Further to the west there is less emphasis on the ruler's feminine nature … [374] … The fact that the rulers in the west are less ‘feminine’, although here also they are definitely the atiut le'u who bear the responsibility for the ritual, is probably primarily a result of a general shift in emphasis on the structural principles, a similar shift to that observable in the kinship system."" (Schulte Nordholt, 1971, pp. 372-374)

""The prince or atupas resides in the centre of the princedom, called by the Atoni ‘the navel of the realm’ (paha usan) … The Timorese word atupas is a derivation from the verb tup, meaning ‘to sleep’, thus designating his function, as ‘he eats and drinks, he sits and sleeps’. The prince is not permitted to be active and is not allowed to leave the precincts of his palace (sonaf); it is his duty to remain ‘inside’. Here he ‘eats and drinks’, in other words, here he offers sacrifices as the principal officiant in charge of the state ritual … As the son of heaven he constitutes the link between the visible and the hidden world, between the Lord of Heaven and man."" (Schulte Nordholt, 1971, p. 200)

However, he was clearly considered to have ultimate secular power in theory. In the princedom of Insana a figure called the kolnel (from the Portuguese 'coronel') acted as the 'right hand' of the atupas who carried out his orders:

""In the relationship atupas-kolnel the atupas must always be immobile and responsible for the ritual, whilst the kolnel, as his ’mouth’ (mafefa) speaks on his behalf, as we have seen in the description of the acceptance of the harvest gifts. The kolnel is active, executing all of the atupas' orders. The latter merely exists, he ‘eats and drinks, sits and sleeps’, while the kolnel is active … Without the atupas his position is inconceivable, but as the atupas' right hand he is the supreme executive authority of the realm."" (Schulte Nordholt, 1971, p. 202)

Other than ritual, the most important role of the atupas appears to have been to manage trade:

“Trade was of prime importance for the administration. In a study of the changes in the political system of Timor the significance of foreign trade will have to be examined at greater depth. The ruler's authority, as that of the heads in general, probably increased greatly as a result of it, as trade was monopolized almost entirely by the ruler, as we may infer from a report (dating back to 1618) by Wang Tsi tsung: 

“‘The market-place is some distance from the town, and whenever a merchant vessel has arrived, the king comes down from the town, accompanied by his wife and children, his concubines and servants, his suite being rather numerous. Taxes have to be paid daily, but they are not heavy. The natives continually bring sandalwood for bartering with the merchants, but they may not come when the king is not present, for fear of disturbances. Therefore the king is always requested to come first.’” (Schulte Nordholt, 1971, p. 358)","schulte-nordholt1971[141-156, 186-231, 326-367]"

'The religion' (Schulte Nordholt, 1971, pp. 141-156)

Schulte Nordholt (1971, pp. 186-231) provides a detailed description of the organization of one Atoni princedom, Insana, which was somewhat atypical since it was never part of the realm of Sonba’i. The author also provides a survey of various others, and discusses the similarities and differences (see p. 381 for a summary). A simplified summary follows. Everywhere the ruler of the princedom was called the atupas. In Insana and possibly Beboki (also outside Sonba’i) the atupas was assisted by a figure called the kolnel (Portuguese ‘colonel’), though this figure did not exist further west. Below the atupas (or the atupas-kolnel in the east) were figures called usif. In Insana and Beboki there were four, each associated with a ‘quarter’ of the princedom, whereas elsewhere there were only two and they were not linked to territorial units. At the same hierarchical level as the usif were the amaf naek (‘great fathers’). In Insana and Beboki they each headed a ‘quarter’ (the same as were headed by the usif), and also played the role of tobe naek.  This quadripartite division also seems to have occurred elsewhere, though it is not clear quite how widespread it was. At a lower level were village elders (amaf or amnasi), each of which represented a particular lineage (ume) localised in one of the hamlets (kuan) which made up a village (also called kuan). 

The atupas was everywhere the religious leader of the princedom, though their role appears to have been less confined to ritual in the west than the east:

""In the discussion of the political system we shall see, however, how important the implications of these fundamental religious notions are for all aspects of life, and especially for the political life, where the raja is the mediator between the living and the dead and between the community of the living and the dead on the one hand and the forces of the hidden world on the other.

18978,manihiki-rakahanga,86,3,150-3,"Manihiki and Rakahanga had an unusual settlement pattern. The population lived on one atoll at a time, and periodically migrated between them due to food shortages:

""Manihiki and Rakahanga, atolls 25 miles apart, are occupied by a people sprung from one family of settlers. The whole population once lived on one atoll at a time and moved back and forth from one atoll to the other when forced to do so by depletions of the coconut and puraka (species of taro) supplies"" (Buck, 1932, p. 4)

There was one village on Rakahanga and two on Manihiki:

""Manihiki is the larger of the two atolls and contains about 1,250 acres of land. It has a fine lagoon abounding in pearl shell and Tridacna, but there are no large natural passages through the reef. The boat passages opposite the two villages are short and boats or canoes must be run up onto the reef, from which they are dragged to the deeper water on the inner side of the reef flat … [5] … Rakahanga, with an area of 1,000 acres, is smaller than Manihiki …The small island, Te Kainga, in the southwest, was the original home of the people, but the site of the single village was changed to Rakahanga across the inter-island channel to the south."" (Buck, 1932, pp. 4-5)

‘Titular system’ (Buck, 1932, pp. 43-56)

‘Tribal history’ (Buck, 1932, pp. 57-65)

The entire population formed a loosely-knit political community. There were four 'tribes' (matakeinanga) that were largely independent and were each headed by a whakamaru. The tribes were grouped into pairs under an ariki, whose role was mostly religious. All four tribes cooperated during migrations between the atolls:

""Each matakeinanga elected its head independently of the others. The special term whakamaru was coined to distinguish him. His powers have been defined. For practical purposes, the matakeinanga was a small tribe, independent of the others as regards local government, but uniting with another matakeinanga under the two priestly ariki for religious purposes. All four matakeinanga federated for voyages back and forth between Mani-hiki and Rakahanga."" (Buck, 1932, p. 60)

The two ariki were called Whainga-aitu and Whakaheo. Their roles were complementary:

""The opposing factions were pacified by a compromise, for the native historians state that in the period of Temu-matua and Tianewa-matua the authority (pohatu) was divided (I to raua tuatau i ngaha te pohatu). The compromise was the creation of a dual arikiship. Temu-matua was made an ariki and was the first to hold the Whainga-aitu title. Tianewa-matua was made an ariki and was the first to hold the Whakaheo title.

“The people also divided into four tribes, and two tribes supported each title. The old tribes, Numatua and Tia-ngaro-tonga, upheld the Whakaheo title. Two newly-created tribes, Heahiro and Mokopuwai, banded together under the leadership of the Whainga-aitu ...  The lands in both Rakahanga and Manihiki became divided among the tribes. The dual ariki ruled over their respective tribes, with evidently no serious friction, as there are no traditional records of local wars. The ariki were supported by their hui rangatira (assembly of chiefs), which included the special officers dealing with land and food, and the heads of subtribes. There was some differentiation in the powers of the two ariki. (See p. 210.) The dual arikiship existed down to the advent of Christianity, when the offices gradually fell into abeyance owing to changed conditions affecting the social structure of the people."" (Buck, 1932, p. 48)

Both ariki roles appear to have been almost exclusively religious:

“The Whainga-aitu title was a full ariki title, but the special term must have been developed locally, for it does not appear, so far as I know, in any other part of Polynesia. The term is said to be derived from the words whai (to follow), nga (the), and aitu (gods). The title thus stresses the priestly functions of the office, for the Whainga-aitu was the principal medium between his people and the gods ...[49] … He ruled over the two tribes, Heahiro and Mokopuwai, but did not interfere in the sharing out of land, which was left to the tribal heads, or whakamaru. The Whainga-aitu was the spiritual head and could command the assistance of the supernormal powers that commanded the productivity of land and sea. The whakamaru were the executives who superintended economic details."" (Buck, 1932, pp. 48-49)

“The term Whakaheo is said to be derived from waka (canoe) and heo (to surround). In the voyages made by the whole population between the two atolls, the ariki holding the title surrounded the canoes with his priestly and supernormal powers and thus insured safe transport ... The Whakaheo had power over the phenomena of nature. He could demonstrate his power by causing the lightning to flash, the thunder to sound, and the rain to fall. He thus controlled the winds and storms, and it was through this power that he was able to surround the voyaging canoes with his priestly protection and insure a safe passage between the atolls.” (Buck, 132, p. 52)

Each ariki was assisted by an 'assembly of chiefs', whose role is not quite clear, as well as 'certain chiefs who had to deal with the economic details within the tribes', about which little is said. The whakamaru were probably the heads of the four tribes. One among them, the moa, was senior and could overrule the others. The moa was 'associated with the Whainga-aitu', but it is not clear that he was under his direct control:

""It was held that each ariki had his hui rangatira (assembly of chiefs). The term hui rangatira is a Rarotongan one which includes the heads of families who are closely related to the ruling ariki ... Associated with the ariki were certain chiefs who had to deal with the economic details within the tribes ... Whakamaru was the local taohanga (title) given to the heads of tribes ... Whakamaru (to give shelter or shade) is thus an expressive term, as the head of the tribe [55] sought to shelter his people. According to some informants, there were two whakamaru under each of the dual ariki, thus making one representative for each of the four tribes. Others seemed to think that the heads of subtribes were also whakamaru. Some of the subtribes must have been fairly small in number, and it is hardly likely that the term would have been applied to the heads of many subtribes ... The duties of the whakamaru were to act as public custodian over tribal lands, to settle disputes, and to prevent outside interference from another tribe. He had to do with directing the planting of food crops and the protection of the coconut plantations and puraka swamps from theft. He had power also over the redistribution of tribal lands which had to be adjusted to the ebb and flow of population. His decision was final, and not even his ariki could interfere with him in matters that concerned the interior economy of the tribe. His status was as high or even higher than that of the ariki in local matters. When it came to questions which concerned the intervention of the tribal gods, however, the ariki was superior, owing to his special priestly functions. From a modern point of view, the whakamaru in his own tribal district was judge of the native land court, Crown ranger, and director of agriculture. He also had a priestly function. When the whole population crossed from one atoll to the other the whakamaru from the tribes went first to the marae to conduct the appropriate ritual to the god (ka whai i to ratou atua). It was also stated that certain lesser tribal gods were in the keeping of the whakamaru.

“The moa was a speaker or messenger between the whakamaru and the ariki. He was a whakamaru appointed by whakamaru. In discussions among the whakamaru he assumed seniority, and his decision was final. The title-holder seemed to be associated particularly with the Whainga-aitu."" (Buck, 1942, pp. 54-55)

Another figure whose authority apparently encompassed the whole population was the papa, whose role was religious and economic:

“The papa was a special title held by one Tuteru-te-tahua. He dealt with economic matters with which the ariki, by virtue of his priestly position, was not allowed to concern himself. He thus controlled land and food supplies. He had power with the Whainga-aitu division through his father and power with the Whakaheo division through his mother. He could thus conduct the religious ritual at the Poutu marae at Tauhunu and at the Akaroa marae at Tukou. He probably was a super whakamaru who by birth and ability carried influence with the whakamaru of the four tribes.” (Buck, 1932, p. 56)","buck1932a[4, 43-65]"

20619,tongareva,85,2,151-2,"""The huaanga was the basic political unit, its members united under an ariki or 'chief and attending the same marae (ritual place); there were about thirteen huaanga in 1853, averaging about 150 members each. The relationships among huaanga were marked by varying degrees of mutual suspicion and hostility, dominance and submission. Groups of four or five adjacent huaanga were united [341] by kinship, realpolitik, or conquest into one of three largely endogamous hititangata, which acted primarily as war confederacies ... Although ariki had some ritual authority-imposing taboos and performing rituals to incorporate strangers, for example-their influence rested largely on control of property and networks of kin and allies ... They
acted as spokespersons, managers of communal work, arbitrators in serious disputes, and war officials ... Although ariki performed certain ritual functions, the principal practitioners were the taura. Invested at, and associated with, specific marae, they acted as mediums for the gods and ancestral spirits, invoking them for assistance in sickness, war, and other troubles. Taura could travel through enemy territory with impunity, and their 'spirit houses' were places of refuge; some taura seem to have possessed secular influence to rival that of the more powerful arikis."" (Roscoe, 1991, pp. 340-341)

“Taking these comments, together with descriptions of actual encounters, into consideration, it is evidence that the huaanga were united at one level into three higher-order ramages … Since the vernacular term for these ramages is unrecorded, I will refer to them as hititangata – a word meaning ‘clan,’ ‘tribe,’ ‘following,’ or ‘people,’ which is applied to a larger or more inclusive group than the huaanga … In geographical terms, each hititangata comprised a number of contiguous huaanga, thereby dividing the atoll into three segments … The only time that the hititangata acted as a group … was when it was mobilized for warfare. In this event, military leadership was determined by (or was in the idiom of) genealogical seniority.” (Campbell, 1985, pp 73-74)",roscoe-1991[340-341];campbell1985[73-74]

19337,tolai,84,1,149-1,"The EOWC entry on Tolai (Epstein 1991) has this to say about ‘religious practitioners’:

“Experts, or melem, are still required for the 'raising' of the tubuan, but knowledge relating to garden and fishing magic and the like seems to have disappeared and the rites are now rarely, if ever, performed. By contrast, the reality of sorcery is still almost universally acknowledged.” (Epstein, 1991, p 335)

(On the same page, Epstein describes the ‘spirit of the tubuan’ as being ‘at the heart’ of Tolai religion.)

Simet (1991, pp 312-378) provides a more detailed account of beliefs and practices relating to the tubuan. Tubuan refers to a special kind of mask, and to a female spirit believed to inhabit the mask. The tara na tubuan (‘tubuan society’ or ‘tubuan fraternity’) appears to have been associated with tubuans in general rather than any specific tubuan. Although it was a Tolai-wide institution, only members living in particular villages appear to have consistently acted as a unit – and even within villages, rituals involving the tubuan seem to have been largely restricted to members of the same clan:

“The tubuan is a masked figure similar to other masked figures found in other parts of Melanesia, such as the hevehe of the Papuan Gulf and the tamate of the Banks Islands in Vanuatu. There are many of these masks, each with particular designs, and are owned by individual clans or lineages. This mask represents a fraternity which is known as the tarai na tubuan (men of the tubuan - but could be translated as 'The Tubuan Society'). This is a fraternity into which men and boys are initiated upon payment of a number of tabu initiation fees. Membership in the society is found in all villages of the mainland Gazelle Peninsula and the nearby islands of Watom and the Duke of Yorks. Only the initiated men and boys are allowed to associate with the tubuan while the women and uninitiated are strictly forbidden on punishment of death or very heavy tabu [shell-money] fines.” (Simet, 1991, p 312)

“The term tubuan refers initially to the combination of mask and wearer and not just the mask alone. When the mask is not being worn, it is separated into three pieces, the pala lor (head-piece), the iwuna (feathers) and the lagulaqu (strap-piece). The three separate parts are referred to by these names, but if any of these pieces or parts of them are donned by a persons or merely held in the hand, a tubuan is formed as if the full mask is being worn. This is usually done in the taraiu (tubuan sanctuary) when the tubuan is quickly needed for some ritual or other purpose, such as giving commands or rounding up the men to perform some chore. This is because it is said that the tabarani ra tubuan (spirit of the tubuan) permeates every part of the mask outside of the sanctuary, the mask must be seen only as a whole, in the form of tubuan … Apart from reference to the mask, the term tubuan is also used to refer to the men who manage the affairs of the tubuan and who are more properly known as bit na tubuan (tubuan managers).” (Simet, 1991, p 315)

“All the Tolai males who have been initiated into the tubuan fraternity and who can enter the sanctuaries, are known as tarai na tubuan (men of the tubuan). They consider themselves to belong to one group, because they observe the same code, a minigui ra tubuan (the tubuan code). But there is no overall organizational body. For most of the time, the members in a particular village locality consider themselves to constitute a unit, but on many occasions they may find themselves being hosts to members from other village localities or they become guests in other villages. In villages as big as Matupit, the membership breaks up into a number of bodies. Thus on Matupit there are three bodies, which coincides with the division of the village into three districts.” (Simet, 1991, p 326)

“In principle all tubuan are tubuan na vunatarai (tubuan of the clan) and are considered to be tubuan na waki (sacred tubuan passed down from the ancestors). Despite the above understanding, not many tubuan that exist at any one time, actually fit under this principle. In any village at any given time, while all tubuan may belong to clans, not all of them are tubuan na waki for some of them may be of recent origin. People acquire these new tubuan for various reasons and there are a number of ways by which they can acquire them … One of the reasons for acquiring kalamana tubuan (new tubuan) is the dispersed nature of clan members throughout a number of villages. A clan localised in one village has one tubuan, but as members move to other villages and form local groups there, they also want their own tubuan to perform their own ritual ceremonies. This means that it is possible for a clan to have as many tubuan as the number of villages its members occupy.” (Simet, 1991, pp 330-331)

Initiation into the tarai na tubuan required ceremonies involving a tubuan ideally belonging to one’s own clan (Simet, 1991, p 365) or, failing that, one’s father’s clan or an allied clan (p 367). 

Melem was the name of the highest of three broad grades constituting the tubuan society. This category was subdivided into further grades. The highest grades can probably be considered offices, in that member of these grades alone acted as ‘managers of the tubuan’. 

“Membership in the fraternity is graded and a person advances to each grade by undergoing appropriate initiations. There are three stages which every man or boy is encouraged to reach, warwolo (admission), rang dawai (second stage initiation) and nidok (third stage initiation). The first of these is the admission initiation which changes the status of a boy from being a maana (non-initiate) to a kalamana (initiate).” (Simet, 1991, p 327)

“Although a person in the kalamana stage has been let into the secret of the mask and can go in and out of the sanctuary whenever he likes, there are still restrictions on what he can do, see, hear and know in the Society … In order to get beyond such restrictions, he has to move on to higher grades. The next stage that he has to reach is guboro, which is attained by the initiation known as rang dawai … After the attainment of guboro, some of the restrictions imposed on a person are lifted, but many still remain. Most of these are lifted at the attainment of the next stage, which is known as melem. This stage is attained through an initiation which is known as nidok … Nidok is the last of the compulsory initiations and it is the watershed in membership in the Tubuan Society. From this point a few men proceed to another two levels, to become bit na tubuan (tubuan managers) and kabin na rakrak (pillars of the fraternity), while the rest remain ordinary members. A person becomes a bit na tubuan when he begins to manage the affairs of a tubuan. A person attains the title of kabin na rakrak after he has successfully staged a series of four tubuan ceremonies, including the nidok initiation.” (Simet, 1991, pp 329-330)",epstein1991[335];simet1991[312-378]

17743,futuna,86,3,150-3,"By the late precontact period Futuna was divided into two chiefdoms:

“After the devastation of Alofitai, Singave was the only region of the two islands not under the sway of the Tua kings. Futuna was thus divided into two districts, Tua and Singave, always hostile and often openly at war. At any given time, the district which had won the last battle – for one decisive battle constituted a war – was called malo (victor), the other lava (vanquished).” (Burrows, 1937, p 37)

How the chiefdoms were governed prior to missionisation is not entirely clear. Burrows provides an overview of district government in the twentieth century, and implies a considerable amount of continuity:

“The governmental units are the villages and the two districts. The districts are independent except that both come under French colonial authority. Each unit is governed by a chief and council: the district by a king (sau or aliki sau) and council of chiefs (fono lasi); the village by a village chief (aliki fenua) and council of householders (fono fenua) … In each district, the district council (fono lasi) meets every Sunday after morning mass. The fono is opened with prayer; this may have been the custom even in pagan times … The other functions of the council fall into four classes: business relating to the French government; district tasks, district merry-making, and punishment of crime. Business relating to the French government is chiefly consideration of means of paying taxes … District tasks consist of such matters as the repair of the road, or the rebuilding of the wall that encircles the island … District merrymaking always takes the form of a katoanga (feast or distribution of food). The most frequent occasions nowadays are church feast days … A special function of the district council is to forbid entry (fakatapu) to any place where natives are not desired … In the old days the king, presumably with the approval of the council, could lay a tapu on food, for a feast or to reserve some delicacy for himself … The district council considers only crimes regarded as especially serious … Very serious offenses, especially those involving Europeans, would be taken up by the French government … Punishment nowadays is nearly always a fine (totongi) … The death penalty and, perhaps, various forms of violence and mutilation may have been in use in the old days; but now that the supreme power is European, they have been abandoned.” (Burrows, 1937, pp 95-98)",burrows1936

“First-order tribes. Next to the household itself, the smallest territorial unit in these Islands was what I called a neighbourhood, consisting of one or more households. Evidence was presented earlier of Maohi beliefs relating to autonomous neighbourhoods, and during the eras when these Islands were being populated there must have been many such. But as noted earlier, by the late Indigenous Era there appear to have been no autonomous territorial units, or tribes, simpler than that of Tetaha, which consisted of several neighbourhoods combined into at least two neighbourhood subunits. Most of the tribes of that era were more complex than that, and even Tetaha was able to preserve its autonomy only by means of shifting alliances with its more complex and populous neighbors.

""Second-order tribes. The simplest tribe larger than a single neighbourhood would have been one composed of two or more neighbourhoods differentiated only to the extent that the chief of one of them exercised final authority over all of them in events involving all of them ... Third-order tribes. Next in order of complexity was a tribe composed of two or more multineighbourhood units each with its own local chief but [977] all subject to the ultimate authority of one among them. On Tahiti itself, during the era under study, this multi-multi-neighbourhood order of complexity seems to have been exemplified only by Fa’a’a (Tetaha, Te Fana I Ahurai).

""Four-order tribes. More complex still was a type of tribe composed of two or more multi-multi-neighbourhood units. On Tahiti one such unit was known as Te Porionu’u, made up of the multi-multineighbourhood units of Pare and Arue, before their overall chief Pomare I succeeded in extending his sway elsewhere … The native label fenua seems to have been applied to tribes of both the third and fourth orders of complexity; and if one follows Morrison’s usage, the major subdivisions of both would have been patu – although according to Bligh, pare and Arure were also known as the two mano of Porionu’u. But again, some writers apply the labels mata’eiana and va’a mata’eina’a to these territorial units and their inhabitants, respectively.

""Fifth-order tribes. A fifth order of complexity was the type of unit latterly exemplified on Tahiti by Teva i uta and Teva i tai. As we saw, Bligh called such units ‘grand divisions’ or ‘Princedoms,’ and Morrison referred to them as ‘alliances’ ... The units I have included in this fifth order of complexity, on Tahiti and elsewhere, differed markedly in degree of integration. Teva i uta (Landward Teva), for example, was an old and fairly stable unit; for a long time before 1767 its three eastern subdivisions (fenua?), Atimaono, Vaiuriri, and Vaiari, had been firmly dominated by the chiefly dynasty of its western division, Papara. And Teva i tai (Seaward Teva), composed of the several second-, third-, and fourth-order units comprising Tahiti’s peninsula, had for some time been a stable union dominated by a single line of chiefs.

""During the five decades after 1767 these and other Tahitian territorial units were linked to one another in various shifting combinations, and in the end all Tahiti (along with Mo’orea) was united into a single, sixth-order unit.” (Oliver, 1974, pp 976-977)",oliver1974[965-1073]
18135,tolai,86,0,150-0,"""There was no central authority or hereditary leadership in the traditional system. Within local communities certain big-men were acknowledged as leaders. A big-man achieved his position by entrepreneurial flair. This flair was demonstrated in his ability to command considerable resources in the form of shell money-resources he put to use in organizing large-scale ceremonies or, in the modern context, in running a business enterprise ... Through their command of wealth in the form of tambu, big-men wielded considerable authority within their own communities. In the past the tubuan, a central figure in the male cult, was said to act as an agent of social control. Disputes between members of the local community were brought before the village assembly or moot; fines might be imposed or compensation awarded, in either case to be paid in tambu ... Until recently arranging for the hearing of disputes was a primary responsibility of the village councillor, but the
village moot or varkurai has now given way to hearings before
village courts, while disputes over land are heard by newly appointed land mediators."" (Epstein, 1991, p. 335)",epstein1991[335]

Pointe avancée des migrations austronésiennes, ils nomadisent en flottilles d'une dizaine d'embarcations regroupant une famille élargie. Ces flottilles, qui se rassemblent à la saison des pluies sur une des îles de résidence, forment des sous-groupes exogames. Le dynamisme identitaire, essentiel à la survie de ce peuple menacé par son éclatement en petites unités à la belle saison propice au nomadisme, est activé lors de ces réunions annuelles. En effet, pour lutter contre les dangers de la saison des pluies où sédentarité et agriculture menacent le groupe et s'opposent aux enseignements de son mythe, les Moken activent la communication avec l'au-delà. C'est alors le temps de la grande fête religieuse des Poteaux aux Esprits, bo loboung, littéralement «faire les poteaux aux esprits» ... [105] ... La fête a lieu chaque année dans les cinq sous-groupes de l'archipel, à la lune montante du cinquième mois (généralement avril), et dure trois, cinq ou sept jours, selon que l'année a été bonne ou mauvaise, ou selon qu'elle se déroule sur une île de résidence principale ou de résidence secondaire.” (Ivanoff, 1992, pp. 103-105)

“The Moken, a few thousand nomadic marine hunter-gatherers, live on the offshore islands of the Mergui archipelago, stretched over four hundred kilometres along the coasts of Thailand and Burma. At a far point of the Austronesian migrations, they migrate in flotillas of ten boats constituting an extended family. These flotillas, which gather in the rainy season on one of the islands of residence, form exogamous subgroups. The dynamism of identity, essential to the survival of these people which is threatened by their break-up into small units in the fine season favourable to migration, is activated during these annual meetings. Indeed, to fight against the dangers of the rainy season when sedentary lifestyle and agriculture threaten the group and oppose the teachings of its myth, the Moken activate communication with the hereafter. It is then the time for the great religious ceremony of Spirit Poles, bo loboung, literally ‘doing the spirit poles’ ... The ceremony is held each year in the five subgroups of the archipelago, at the rising moon of the fifth month (usually April), and lasts three, five, or seven days, depending on whether the year has been good or bad, or whether it takes place on an island of primary or secondary residence.""

‘Les officiants’ (Ivanoff, 1992, pp. 108-110)

""Tous les officiants sont considérés comme des aînés. Leur puissance spirituelle transcende le cadre de la parenté réelle. Toutes les flottilles, qui, chacune à le [108] rejoignent le chamane pour la célébration du rituel, lui offrent un sac de riz, des accompagnements ou de l'alcool ... … A la saison sèche, chaque ancien de flottille est responsable du bien-être spiritual des hommes, essentiellement par le biais de techniques de guérison durant lesquelles il  entre en transe médiumnique … Le nombre idéal d'officiants pour un rituel serait de deux chamanes (celui en titre, plus le successeur), deux maîtres de rituels (un sous les ordres de l'autre), un guerrier, une dizaine d'apprentis et autant de danseuses et chanteuses sacrées. Les officiants réunis à terre pour la célébration des Poteaux aux Esprits forment donc une communauté d'anciens potao. En conséquence, tous les vieux, les personnes ayant environ cinquante ans, possèdent une position dans la hiérarchie religieuse et tissent, à travers les îles et les sous-groupes, des réseaux de solidarité et de communication (ils peuvent communiquer entre eux, à distance, par l'intermédiaire des rêves, des transes et des esprits-messagers)  … Le chamane y le djinyang moken, est au sommet de la hiérarchie des officiants, telle qu'elle est définie par les Moken eux-mêmes. Car, entrant en transe, tour à tour possédé et voyageur de l'au-delà, où il se rend pour recueillir le message des esprits, il est le seul à pouvoir voyager impunément dans les différents mondes qui se côtoient dans l'univers moken. Considéré simplement comme un ancien à la saison des pluies, il porte alors un turban noir. Le port de son turban blanc indique sa fonction de chef spirituel. Celle-ci est à tendance héréditaire, même si les Moken ne le disent pas explicitement. Pour sa succession, on cherche d'abord parmi les enfants proches celui qui manifeste des prédispositions à être chamane. Si on ne le trouve pas, on va enquêter un peu plus loin dans la parentèle, mais sans trop s'éloigner ni géographiquement ni généalogique- ment. C'est le chamane qui officialise le choix en partageant son turban noir.” (Ivanoff, 1992, pp. 107-108)

""All the officiants are considered elders. Their spiritual power transcends the framework of real kinship. All the flotillas, which [108] join the shaman to celebrate the ritual, offer him a bag of rice, side dishes or alcohol ... In the dry season, the elder of each flotilla is responsible for the spiritual well-being of the people, mainly through healing techniques during which he goes into a medium-like trance … The ideal number of officiants for a ritual is two shamans (one with the title, plus the successor), two masters of ritual (one under the orders of the other), a warrior, ten apprentices and as many sacred dancers and singers. The officiants reunited on land for the celebration of the ceremony of the Spirit Poles form therefore a community of old elders. In consequence, all old people, people of about fifty years, have a position in the religious hieararchy and weave, across the islands and sub-groups, networks of solidarity and communication (they can communicate at a distance through dreams, trances, and spirit-messengers) … The shaman, djinyang in Moken, is at the top of the hierarchy of officiants, as defined by the Moken themselves. For, entering a trance … he is the only one who can travel with impunity in the different worlds that rub shoulders in the Moken universe. Considered simply an elder in the rainy season, he then wears a black turban. Wearing a white turban indicates his function as spiritual leader. This has a hereditary tendency, although the Moken do not say so explicitly. For his succession, on searches among his nearby children the one who shows the predispositions to be a shaman.

Other religious officiants:

“Le guerrier (ulu balang) est un médium respecté, craint parfois, car il est en relation avec les mauvais esprits qu'il est chargé de repousser, notamment durant le voyage du chamane, ce qui le désigne souvent comme responsable en cas de difficulté …L'apprenti (belam) est un médium masculin qui possède souvent des techniques de guérisseur …. Le maître du rituel (léphèng) est responsable de l'organisation matérielle des grandes cérémonies … La mère et les filles sacrées. Parallèlement à la hiérarchie masculine, les femmes ont une place dans l 'organisation du rituel, bien que leur rôle soit plus important en tant qu'ancêtres qu'en tant qu'officiantes. La bona, «mère», est présente dans le monde des vivants et dans le monde des ancêtres. Elle se charge d'ouvrir les «portes» et de porter les offrandes aux divinités.

[110]

“Quelques femmes sont des officiantes dans le monde des vivants, dont la lémang, «l'assistante du chamane» (généralement son épouse), qui est chargée de la bonne ordonnance de certaines cérémonies et est responsable des principales portes de communication avec l'au-delà: le feu et le bétel. Elle n'entre pas en transe. Son rôle peut se comparer à celui du maître du rituel bien qu'il soit moins important. Elle est plutôt la représentante de la communauté feminine.
“Les siti, «chanteuses et danseuses sacrées», réjouissent les ancêtres. Elles ont un rôle de première importance puisqu’elles donnent à la fête son aspect spectaculaire. mportance puisqu'elles donnent à la fête son aspect spectaculaire. Ce sont les chanteuses favorites du groupe, des danseuses reconnues, des musiciennes passionnées.” (Ivanoff, 1992, pp. 109-110)

“The warrior (ulu balang) is a respected medium, sometimes feared, because he is in contact with the evil spirits that he is responsible for repelling, especially during the shaman’s journey, which often designates him as responsible in case of difficulty … The apprentice (belam) is a male medium who often has healing techniques … The master of ritual (léphèng) is responsible for the material organization of the great ceremonies … The sacred mother and daughters. Paralleling the male hierarchy, women have a place in the organization of the ritual, although their role is more important as ancestors than as officiants. The bona, ‘mother’, is present in the world of the living and in the world of the ancestors. She is responsible for opening the ‘doors’ and carrying the offerings to the divinities. [110]  Some women are officiants in the living world, including the lémang, ‘shaman’s assistant’ (usually his wife), who is responsible for the proper ordering of certain ceremonies and is responsible for the main means of communication with the hereafter: fire and betel. She does not go into a trance. This role can be compared to that of the master of ritual although it is less important. Rather, she is the representative of the female community.

“The siti, ‘sacred singers and dangers’, celebrate the ancestors … They are the favourite singers of the group, recognised dancers, passionate musicians.” (Ivanoff, 1992, pp. 109-110)",ivanoff1992

Parallèlement à la hiérarchie masculine, les femmes ont une place dans l 'organisation du rituel, bien que leur rôle soit plus important en tant qu'ancêtres qu'en tant qu'officiantes. La bona, «mère», est présente dans le monde des vivants et dans le monde des ancêtres. Elle se charge d'ouvrir les «portes» et de porter les offrandes aux divinités.

[110]

“Quelques femmes sont des officiantes dans le monde des vivants, dont la lémang, «l'assistante du chamane» (généralement son épouse), qui est chargée de la bonne ordonnance de certaines cérémonies et est responsable des principales portes de communication avec l'au-delà: le feu et le bétel. Elle n'entre pas en transe. Son rôle peut se comparer à celui du maître du rituel bien qu'il soit moins important. Elle est plutôt la représentante de la communauté feminine.
“Les siti, «chanteuses et danseuses sacrées», réjouissent les ancêtres. Elles ont un rôle de première importance puisqu’elles donnent à la fête son aspect spectaculaire. mportance puisqu'elles donnent à la fête son aspect spectaculaire. Ce sont les chanteuses favorites du groupe, des danseuses reconnues, des musiciennes passionnées.” (Ivanoff, 1992, pp. 109-110)

“The warrior (ulu balang) is a respected medium, sometimes feared, because he is in contact with the evil spirits that he is responsible for repelling, especially during the shaman’s journey, which often designates him as responsible in case of difficulty … The apprentice (belam) is a male medium who often has healing techniques … The master of ritual (léphèng) is responsible for the material organization of the great ceremonies … The sacred mother and daughters. Paralleling the male hierarchy, women have a place in the organization of the ritual, although their role is more important as ancestors than as officiants. The bona, ‘mother’, is present in the world of the living and in the world of the ancestors. She is responsible for opening the ‘doors’ and carrying the offerings to the divinities. [110]  Some women are officiants in the living world, including the lémang, ‘shaman’s assistant’ (usually his wife), who is responsible for the proper ordering of certain ceremonies and is responsible for the main means of communication with the hereafter: fire and betel. She does not go into a trance. This role can be compared to that of the master of ritual although it is less important. Rather, she is the representative of the female community.

“The siti, ‘sacred singers and dangers’, celebrate the ancestors … They are the favourite singers of the group, recognised dancers, passionate musicians.” (Ivanoff, 1992, pp. 109-110)",ivanoff1992

‘Chiefs’ (Held, 1957, pp. 69-81)

The Waropen lived in villages divided into clans (da). Clans had leaders, but it seems that villages did not until the appointment of village chiefs by the Dutch. The head of the clan was the serambawa. 

""The Waropen villages of the Kai distict are divided into two, four or five da. A da is a local, non-exogamous group formed by a number of ruma, houses, which, however, are exogamous.""(Held, 1957, p  47)

“General controlling powers, when necessary supported by external compulsion, are to be looked for in vain as regards the Waropen clan-chief. This is quite likely the reason why writers report again and again that in this society the power of chiefs does not exist. The clan-chief should not believe for a moment that his personal orders would be obeyed; in this respect the members of the clan feel themselves too much members of the family. But on the other hand it would be a mistake to underrate the influence of the clan-chief in matters of everyday life; a clan-chief who is able to become the organ of the communis opinio of his fellow-clansmen may quite well acquire great influence … The fact that the clan-chief can really interfere is shown by one of the stories I took down. There [75] it is said that a famine started in a certain place, 'and thereupon', the story continues, 'their clan-chief ordered them to leave' (Texts 178). 

“However, the clan-chief can do little by himself and therefore he always acts in consultation with other influential men, the so-called manobawa, the great men, i.e. the well-known warriors and the leaders of the various important family-branches. In that case the serabawa and the manobawa together form a kind of council of elders, which usually meets on the porch of the seraruma. All important matters are discussed at these meeting sand it is a question of personal authority whether a person is able to impose his will on the meeting."" (Held, 1957, pp 74-75)
“In short, one may say that the clan-chief, usually together with the other old men of his clan, acts when there are unpaid debts in his clan. Where ‘suangi’ or other excommunicated persons are concerned, blood has usually to be paid with blood. Hence, the clan-chief and his elders came to act also in all cases of serious violation of adat law … Another chapter will be devoted to the function of the clan-chief as leader of the raiding-party, where he attempts to obtain slaves and the property of others, or to revenge the blood lost by his clan by causing other blood to flow.” (Held, 1957, pp. 74-75)

""The position of the clan-chief is not that of a village burgomaster with clearly defined administrative duties. The former serabawa was the leader of the raiding-parties; and in general the leader of the potlatch-ritual. With the support of the prominent old men he was quite able to exercise considerable influence. The clan-chief and his men saw to the payment of the wergeld, the execution of ‘suangi’ [sorcerers] and the punishment of serious infractions of adat law, because he was the direct, more or less sacred descendant of the ancestors who had once established the moral order and who still now continue to threaten violations of that order with punishment. On the other hand the feeling of solidarity of the clan is so great that the clan-chief need not think [81] for a moment that he might govern his waribo [followers]; he has no powers at his disposal to enable him to give arbitrary commands or to enforce obedience.""

'Raiding and trading' (Held, 1957, pp. 198-233)

‘The sacred and the profane’ (Held, 1957, pp. 234-267)

The only religious specialist that Held mentions is the Ghasaiwin (shaman) (Held, 1957. pp. 246-253, 'Ghasaiwin'). These appear to have been associated with particular clans, but to have served individual clients, most but not all of whom were from that clan. It appears that the role of Ghasaiwin was an office, but it is not quite clear that it conferred authority over a specific group:

""Not everybody is daring enough to venture forth into the realm of sacred things. Among the Waropen there exists a special group of persons who may enter into the supernatural field with impunity, and these are the ghasaiwin.

""Ghasaiwin are old women who, after a specialist training, are able without danger to enter into contact with sacred matters and who make it their occupation to mediate in this contact on behalf of others … Every clan has a ghasaiwin of its own, who mainly also acts only on behalf of members of her own clan, and who when she appears in any case, addresses herself to a certain series of ancestors. In many cases the ghasaiwin even maintains relations only with certain local representatives of the mythical beings. A person, therefore, who calls in the help of a ghasaiwin, e.g. in case of sickness, can only cover a small part of the sacred realm."" (Held, 1957, p 246)

""Her work is partly preventive, viz. to prevent that the dare [spirits] … harm the young children. But her main task is still to bring back those small children whose soul has wandered off too far, a danger to which children seem to be constantly exposed before their first saira [initiation ritual]. It is mainly the auo [spirits] and the ancestors who keep back the souls of the children."" (Held, 1957, p. 247)

The role of serabawa (‘clan chief’) certainly had a religious component, though this seems more a case of religious beliefs legitimating political authority than religious authority per se. The duties of the serabawa are are described as follows:

""The former serabawa was the leader of the raiding-parties; and in general the leader of the potlatch-ritual. With the support of the prominent old men he was quite able to exercise considerable influence. The clan-chief and his men saw to the payment of the wergeld, the execution of ‘suangi’ [sorcerers] and the punishment of serious infractions of adat law, because he was the direct, more or less sacred descendant of the ancestors who had once established the moral order and who still now continue to threaten violations of that order with punishment."" (Held, 1957, p. 80)

Raiding was motivated (or at least justified) at least in part by religious considerations, though the ‘potlatch ritual’ appears to have been secular. 

""In the Waropen area the raid is an institution which possesses several functions that have not been integrated into one definite cultural trait. Here the raid was, for instance, not a purely ritual matter, to which all members of the clan had to submit. Whoever wished to remain at home because he was afraid, need not fear immediate supernatural corrections.

""On the other hand, the image of the redoubtable raider stood as a shining example before the eyes of the ambitious youth … [214] … The raid was therefore the institutionalized method for a young man to distinguish himself … Moreover, the relation between the raid and religion is also still clearly apparent. We only need to remember that the raid was an affair of the clan, under the direct guidance of the ancestors to whom in fact the whole feast of the catching of slaves was dedicated."" (Held, 1957, pp. 213-214)

""One of the important things during a raid was to acquire a skull … [215] … It is clear that the skull, which presumably represents the whole person as a pars pro toto, is meant as an offering of the dead man to the ancestors under whose supervision all raiding activities take place."" (Held, 1957, pp. 214-215)

""I presume that in the raiding activities this economic motive was tending to become increasingly important. Initially, hunting for a head was perhaps the final test the initiandus had to perform under the guidance of the adult men. After the presentation of a head to the ancestors of the clan the initiandus could be taken up again into society. The head is therefore also the sacrifice to the ancestors, by means of which the initiandus was freed from religious isolation … With the development of differences in [226] status and the accompanying disintegration of the ritual of the clan and of initiation, the chiefs, whose position rises above the clan-organisation, might try to increase their influence - which was gradually growing due to the system of the obligatory exchange of gifts on the occasion of the feasts - by means of the ransom for the ghomino [slaves].

""Perhaps the regulated raids might have developed in the future into a battle of gifts, like this was described concerning the presentation of the dowry and of the countergifts among marriage-partners. Already at this time there existed a potlatch relationship between the clan-chiefs, at least when acquiring a name, when one party challenged the other with a stake consisting of an honorific title and presents on one side and a slave on the other. Real potlatch customs were likewise known among the Waropen. In this way people could challenge each other with their stocks of food, A challenging B that B will never be able to collect so much sago that A would be unable to buy this by means of silver armlets. If B does not want to become ‘ashamed’, B has to accept the challenge. The winner acquires the goods that have been staked by the opposing party. Or A buys a large prahu and challenges B to buy an exactly similar prahu, at the risk of losing a certain quantity of goods (kisionamakudaruko, they taunt each other, they make sarcastic remarks about each other)."" (Held, 1957, p. 226)

More on the supernatural role of the serabawa:

""The prerogatives of the nobility are protected by the belief in the myth concerning their establishment by the ancestors. The ancestors would punish those persons with illness who would presume to arrogate things to themselves which were not in accordance with their station … In the marriages we observed, the clan-chief acted as the person who concluded the marriage; our informants told us that this was really very good, but still not necessary. Any other superior, properly married man would also be able to do so. Nor was the clan-chief ex officio the leader of the initiation ritual; the initiator is the mother's brother. However, the dama [‘initiation house’] had to stand at the side of the seraruma  [chief’s house] and because this dama was the clan-sanctuary, as will be shown below, one is at once led to suppose that the serabawa was also concerned in some way with the dama."" (Held, 1957, p 74)

""The serabawa is considered to be the most direct descendant of the mythical ancestor of the clan and for this reason he enjoys religious respect, as already indicated by the name sera, nobleman, divinity. It is often believed that they are able to heal the sick. Ghamabai, younger brother of the chief of the Sawaki clan, is considered to be an expert in the preparation of charms and potions. Concerning the clan-chief of Nuwuri I was assured that more than once he had revived people who had been killed by the sema [sorcerers].""  (Held, 1957, p 75)","held1957[45-85, 198-267]"

In the past there may have been two moieties (ngopu) within each tribe, but at the time of Hau'ofa's fieldwork this unit appears to have been recognised only among the Northern Ve'e. Descent groups of a lower order than the ngopu were called ikupu, a name given to dispersed clans, as well as to 'subclans' or localised branches of these clans. Villages were called pangua, and at least some of them consisted of 'wards' that were also called pangua:

“Mekeo includes two tribes, Pioufa and Ve’e. The latter is divided into two territorial units, Northern and Southern Ve'e, separated by the intervening territory of the Pioufa ... Seligmann (1910:327) wrote that each of the two tribes includes two ngopu groups. A ngopu consists of a number of pangua or clans claiming common patrilineal descent ... 'Each village consists of portions of a varying number of pangua (clans or local groups), representatives of each of which are found in few or many villages according to the strength and amount of dispersion of particular clans’ (Seligmann 1910:312). Within the localised branch of a clan are units called ikupu or 'family groups', branches of the pangua ... Most of my informants from the Pioufa tribe expressed complete ignorance of what a ngopu is, a clear indication of the fact that this tribal unit is no longer of significance among the Pioufa. The few, mostly elderly men, who know the term gave conflicting answers ... Among the Northern Ve’e there is no doubt that the ngopu as defined by Seligmann still exists and operates most conspicuously on ceremonial occasions ... [30] ... Of more relevance to the present chapter are Seligmann’s statements that pangua refers to clans, and ikupu to 'family groups' or lineages within the localised branches of clans. The word pangua, as used by the people today, has only territorial connotations, and certainly does not apply to a social unit as such. Whether it ever meant 'clan' is a moot point; I am inclined to think that it did not. Mekeo use the term variously to mean a 'village', a 'settlement', a 'residential section' or 'ward' within a village, or even a 'country' ... When people refer to clans and localised subclans they use the word ikupu ... [31] ... Lineages or ‘family
groups’ (in Seligmann’s usage) of a local branch of a clan are not necessarily referred to by the term ikupu—as Seligmann asserted —unless they have attained a certain degree of autonomy from the parent group ... In the remainder of this study 1 shall use the word pangua to mean 'village' or 'ward', and ikupu to refer to dispersed clans as well as to localised subclans (cf. Humphries 1923:223)."" (Hau'ofa, 1981, pp. 27-31)

Each ward appears to have been associated with a 'founding subclan' who retained political dominance, but often included 'affiliated' subclans: 

""The village comprises five named pangua or wards: Ongofo’ina,
Inaufokoa, Inau’i, Fopafo’ina and Aloaivea, each deriving its name from its founding ikupu or subclan."" (Hau'ofa, 1981, p. 34)

""These five subclans formed the nuclei of the five village wards. As the settlement grew, internal disputes precipitated the emigration of whole sections or smaller groups to other villages ... Those who left were replaced by other groups who had either been similarly pushed out from their own villages or had been in the area when the Pioufa first arrived. This is the explanation given by the villagers for the fact that all the wards of Beipa’a, with the single exception of Inaufokoa, are composed of more than one subclan (Table 2)."" (Hau'ofa, 1981, p. 36)

""The founding and dominant subclans of the village wards insist that their forefathers emigrated from the ancestral settlements of Isoisovapu and Isoisovina. This is true of most if not all Mekeo villages. The affiliated subclans, on the other hand, are mostly of non-Mekeo origin. It is probable that the migrants from the ancestral villages moved into the region between the Angabunga and Inawafunga Rivers and subjugated the small groups of people who were already there. This would explain in part the present dominant positions of the founding subclans and their chiefs over the affiliated subclans and their leaders."" (Hau'ofa, 1981, p. 39)

The largest group that had the potential to act as a unit was clearly the tribe. Pioufa functioned as a military alliance, but neither Ve'e nor either of its subgroups appears to have any unity. According to Hau'ofa, Pioufa lacked any 'formal tribal-wide organisation besides that of the military', which appears to have been a loose network rather than a hierarchical command structure. However, Hau'ofa also describes Pioufa as having had a 'most senior chief' (who may have received tribute), a 'principal python magician', and a 'head war magician': 

""In the face of intertribal warfare, the long stability of the three main Pioufa villages was probably due to a large extent to their central locations, protected from outsiders by a ring of four small peripheral villages, Amoamo, Oriropetana, Inawae and Afa'i  ... Old men in these small villages said that in the precolonial past, when Pioufa was a more unified tribe, the peripheral villages acted as frontline outposts defending the main body of the tribe, three quarters of which lived in the three central villages ... Whether or not there was a deliberate, overall tribal defence plan in the location of its villages, the strategic location of the peripheral settlements are in themselves very significant ... [43] ... The position of the peripheral Pioufa villages was far from that of subservience to the central ones. The latter were dependent on them for their security and stability so could not afford to antagonise [44] them lest they emigrate elsewhere. The military interdependence between the peripheral and the central Pioufa villages was that facilitated by their proximity to each other ... Another factor which probably helped in maintaining an equitable balance between the central and the peripheral villages was that each of the small villages - except Afa'i about which I had no information - had mystical powers (or in one case, ceremonial position) superior to those of the central villages. The main chief of Oriropetana was, and still is, the most senior chief of all Pioufa. The present chief of that village once told me that in the past his forefathers received food tributes from distributions at feasts held in the villages of the entire tribe. Inawae had the third most senior sorcery lineage in the whole of Mekeo (the most senior sorcerers were from Bebeo, a small 'outpost' of Northern Ve'e). In Amoamo village lived the principal python magician in Pioufa ...  Although warfare was chronic, it is not the case that every tribe fought every other tribe all the time ... The wars fought by Mekeo at the onset of the colonial period were those among the Southern Ve'e villages themselves (BNG 1891-2:17) and between Amoamo and [the Northern Ve'e village of] Rarai ... [45] ... The forcible cessation of tribal warfare necessarily undermined the military authority, and although military leadership still survives it exists largely in a ceremonial sense. Furthermore, the cessation of warfare and threats of war removed the institution which provided the only formal organization for the whole Pioufa tribe, that is, the major military ceremonies and feasts. Apart from its territorial significance, the political importance of the tribe in the precolonial past lay in its military value: it was the largest territorial grouping for military co-operation and also the largest unit within which warfare was not supposed to be waged. There was no formal tribal-wide organisation besides that of the military. The largest group over which a Mekeo civilian chief had, and still has, primary authority is the ward. The military ceremonies involved large feasts which were for all the war chiefs of the tribe. These ceremonies maintained ties and obligations to be exploited when a group waging war needed assistance from others. The main civilian ceremonies, on the other hand, involved only a limited number of groups which constitute feasting and ceremonial dyads known as ufuapie ... With the abolition of warfare, military ceremonies ceased and with them the only tribal-wide ceremonial ties disappeared. The last military ceremony to be held in Beipa'a was in 1921 with the death of Foisau Aisama'a, the head [46] war magician of all Pioufa."" (Hau'ofa, 1981, pp. 42-46) 

Mekeo supernatural beliefs centred on isapu, something like 'magical power':

“Underlying all positions of authority and all important activities in Mekeo society is the phenomenon of power, isapu, and the knowledge and skill in applying it to nature and to man. Isapu, which literally means ‘heat’, is ritual and magical in character. No activity of any significance can be successful without the knowledge and practice of the particular power associated with it.” (Hau’ofa, 1981, p. 215)

Harmful forms of isapu were believed to be more powerful than beneficent ones, making practitioners of black magic particularly important. There were four principal leadership offices in Mekeo society: 'civilian chief', 'sorcerer', 'war chief', and 'war magician'. Civilian chiefs and war chiefs were considered 'good' and hence were not able to use malevolent magic legitimately, unlike sorcerers and war magicians, who were considered 'bad'. The 'sorcerer' is described as the civilian chief's 'policeman and bodyguard' and as being unable to act legitimately without the chief's permission. This must also have been true of the war magician, since the sorcerer is described as being 'to the civilian chief as the war magician is to the war chief':

“It follows from this that the traditional leadership offices of war chiefs, war magicians, civilian chiefs, and sorcerers, are offices with powers stronger than those of ordinary people. We have seen that through the seniority system eldest sons (and thus hereditary leaders) inherit, as a rule, the most important magical powers of their fathers. I return to this point below.” (Hau'ofa, 1981, p. 216)

“The division between the civilian and military leadership, as we have seen, is perceived in moral terms as being that of separating powers which are predominantly bad and powers which are essentially good. But true to the logic of the two-sided moral evaluation of things, the military is also good, and the civilian is also bad. This moral ambivalence is evidence in a further subdivision within each of the two fields of leadership. These subdivisions may be seen as attempts to resolve the ambivalence by separating further still the good and the bad powers. In the military sphere, the war chief represents the relatively good and less dangerous powers; he operates in the open as the leader of war parties and conducted of public ceremonies and rituals related to warfare. The war magician represents the bad aspects; he operates in secrecy in the darkness of night, and is in possession of the most dangerous powers associated with warfare ... In the civilian sphere, the good is projected onto the office and person of the civilian chief, and the bad and dangerous are personified by the sorcerer, who is the power behind the chief and is the chief’s execu- [218] tioner. The sorcerer is to the civilian chief as the war magician is to the war chief.

“This introduces us to another important consideration of isapu. There are different kinds of isapu with varying degrees of potency ranging from the ordinary and universally distributed to the most potent and exclusive. Intrinsic to the potency of powers is the degree of danger associated with them, so that the most potent are also the most dangerous, fearsome and evil. War magic and sorcery are the most potent powers of all, so it is not surprising that they are parts of the military and the civilian orders of leadership. Traditional authority in Mekeo rests on mystical powers of the most dangerous kinds, and succession to hereditary offices of leadership is, in the final analysis, accession to positions of isapu."" (Hau'ofa, 1981, pp. 217-218)

“In replying to questions about the structure of civilian leadership, Mekeo willingly make statements in accordance with the ideals they hold. They tell the inquirer that chiefs are backed by sorcerers. ‘The lopia stands in front and the ungaunga is always behind him.’ The sorcerer, they say, is the chief’s policeman and bodyguard. When someone becomes a nuisance or a public menace, the chief instructs his sorcerer to discipline or to kill him. The sorcerer does not attack anyone unless instructed or permitted by the chief.” (Hau'ofa, 1981, p. 250)

The office of 'civilian chief' (lopia fa'a) was primarily limited to the 'subclan', though most villages recognized one civilian chief as the village chief in at least a ceremonial capacity:

""Since Seligmann’s description of Mekeo chieftainship is based on information collected in the early years of encounter with Europeans, I shall use a brief summary of it as the basis of my analysis. Seligmann (1910:342-8) stated that each subclan has or should have two leaders: a high chief, lopia fa’a, and a war chief, iso lopia, with the former ranking higher in authority than the latter. Many subclans are divided into two sections, fa ’aniau and eke'i, the headmen of the latter being officially called lopia eke'i. Seligmann offers no English translation for lopia eke'i who, he said, are henchmen and assistants of their superiors, the high chiefs ... As a rule high chiefs do not take active part in warfare unless their [185] villages are subjected to surprise nocturnal attacks. In ordinary fights they can stop hostilities by parading unarmed between the combatant lines shaking lime from their gourds ... The responsibility for all matters related to warfare rests on war chiefs who can have their own ufu [hall] for the performance of the functions pertaining to their office ... With the exception of Beipa’a, Aipiana and Rarai, each village in Pioufa and Northern Ve’e has a senior chief who is considered the head chief of the village. These are chiefs of subclans which founded their respective villages. The pre-eminence of the head chief of a village is largely ceremonial and symbolic, although a strong and resourceful head chief, like Vitolo Mainonga of Imounga, can use his position to become effectively dominant over the whole village (cf. MacGregor in BNG 1889-90:80; Stephen 1974). A senior chief’s primary authority, however, is largely confined to his subclan or ward."" (Hau’ofa, 1981, pp. 184-185)

""The distinction made by Seligmann between the ‘high chief’ and the ‘war chief’ needs clarification. Properly speaking, the more basic distinction is that between pangua lopianga, ‘chieftainship of the village’, and iso lopianga, ‘chieftainship of the spear’. This distinction refers to the fundamental division of authority in Mekeo society between the civilian and the military. In a fully grown subclan, the civilian chieftainship is divided between the lopia fa’a(niau) and the lopia eke (plural lopia eke’i). We have seen in Chapter 4 that the terms [185] fa ’aniau and eke mean ‘senior’ and ‘junior’ respectively. Henceforth, I shall use the terms ‘senior chiefs’ and ‘junior chiefs’ in reference to the holders of the top civilian offices. Seligmann’s use of the term ‘high chief’ is correct in so far as it indicates the higher ranking and authority of the senior over junior and war chiefs."" (Hau'ofa, 1981, pp. 185-186)

The ngopu does not appear to have had a single chief, but the subclans that made up a ngopu among the Northern Ve'e were to some extent subject to the authority of the 'chiefs of the senior branches of the ngopu':

""In late 1972 I went to a feast in the Northern Ve'e village of Imounga in which the whole population of the village was divided into two groups: those who had assisted the feast-giving subclan and those who arrayed themselves with the official guests. [30] Representatives of clans of other Northern Ve'e villages attended the feast and aligned themselves with one or the other group on the basis of their ngopu affiliations (the two ngopu being Kuapengi and Ngangai). The ngopu affiliations were, with one exception, exactly along the lines documented by Seligmann [sic]. Early in the same year I attended a feast for the installation of a new chief of Ngangai (Northern Ve'e) subclan in the Inawi (Pioufa) village. The feast was attended by the branches of the Ngangai ngopu from Northern Ve'e to oversee the preparations and the installation. The feast-giving chief told me that he could not install his successor without consultation with, and the actual presence of, the chiefs of the senior branches of the ngopu."" (Hau’ofa, 1981, pp. 27-30)

Altogether, it seems that the effective authority of any one civilian chief did not go beyond the village, though the authority of groups of chiefs extended to the ngopu in at least one of the major Mekeo subgroups. No 'tribal chiefs' are described, though there is mention of the 'most senior chief of all Pioufa' mentioned on p. 44 had only nominal precedence, and perhaps also a right to tribute. 

Since the civilian chief had authority over the war chief at least in theory, and sorcerers and war magicians were under the authority of civilian chiefs and war chiefs respectively, it seems implausible that either the sorcerer or the war magician could have had a wider sphere of authority than the civilian chief. Given this, mention of a 'head war magician of all Pioufa' (pp. 45-46) is puzzling in this context, but it is possible that this simply referred to the most senior or prestigious war magician in the tribe, rather than there being an office of 'head war magician' who served the entire tribe.","hauofa1981[42-46, 184-288]"

19251,ontong-java,84,3,149-3,"“Formerly there were dwellings on practically all the islands, and large villages on Luangiua, Pelau, Keila, Kiloma, Kepae, Kemalu, and ‘Avaha. The only two villages of any size to-day are on Luangiua and Pelau.

“The people are divided into two tribes. The members of one tribe, the less important both socially and numerically, own the part of the atoll near the island of Pelau, while the members of the other own all the remaining islands. Each tribe has its main village, one situated on Pelau island and [94] one on Luangiua. They have no distinguishing native names, but it will be convenient to call each after its own island.

“Each tribe is made up of a number of joint families, groups of individuals who are closely related. The joint family forms a compact unit, for it is practically autonomous, and the members own land and property jointly. Other economic units are the canoe-owning group, the house-owning group, the gardening group and the household. The tribe as a whole combines only to carry out religious ceremonies, the most important of which centre around the sanga rites, performed for one month of every year. Each tribe has a temple in its main village, and here ceremonies were formerly carried out daily by the priests.” (Hogbin, 1934, pp. 93-94)

‘Religious institutions’ (Hogbin, 1934, pp. 166-168)

“OUR examination of the culture of Ontong Java has so far been confined to the relations between each individual and members of certain limited groups, which might be called primary groups, since, as we have shown, the members co-operate with one another practically all the time … But each of these primary groups represents only a small portion of the community. A joint family might at its maximum have included fifty persons, while the Luangiua tribe of pre-European days numbered three to four thousand. We now have to investigate how order was maintained within the society as a whole, or what were the forces regulating the relations of any individual towards members of primary groups to which he did not belong. For this purpose we must investigate the activities in which the whole tribe takes part.

“These activities consist almost entirely in religious ceremonies. These are mainly concerned with the priests, of whom I shall speak by their native name of maakua or ali'i. The [167] Luangiua tribe had eight maakua. The position of headman
in the joint families of the islands of Keila, Kepae, Kiloma, Kemalu, Akaha, Oko, and Keuolei carried with it the office of priest; that is to say, the headman of these groups were also maakua. The eighth maakua was the next senior man after the headman in the Kemalu joint family. Two members of this group were, therefore, maakua … The three maakua of Keila, Kepae and Kiloma may be distinguished from the other five. They had no special native name, but it will be convenient to speak of them as the major maakua. Each major maakua had an executive officer, his ka'ala. This man was either his sister's son or a man so classified. The two maakua of Akaha and Oko had special duties and had the additional title of ko'oi.' The remaining three, the two of Kemalu and the one of Keuolei, we will speak of as the minor maakua.

“The Pelau tribe had six maakua. Three of these were major maakua and three were ko'oi, there being no minor maakua.
To-day there are no maakua. The last died in 1925, more than two years before I first visited the atoll. It was consequently not possible to get information concerning them at first hand, and I had to rely entirely upon what other people told me.

Every year the whole Luangiua tribe came to their main village to celebrate a festival known as sanga. The festival lasted a month, on every day of which a different ceremony had to be performed. The maakua directed these ceremonies. When the last one had been carried out to its conclusion [168] all but one major maakua and one ko'oi returned to their islands. After they had departed any of the other people who wished were free to return also, though if they preferred to do so they remained on the main island. 

“Until twelve lunar months had passed, when the time for sanga came round again, the major maakua who had been left at Luangiua acted as the religious head of the tribe. Assisted by the ko'oi, he performed certain ceremonies every day to make the coconut and taro crops of the whole tribe flourish and to make the fish in the lagoon plentiful. After the next sanga these two maakua were replaced by two others, a major maakua and the other ko'oi. The following year the third major maakua held office and was assisted by the first ko'oi, and so it went on in regular rotation. 

“Pelau also had its sanga, identical in most respects with sanga at Luangiua. After the festival had concluded there, one major maakua, assisted by a ko'oi, acted as religious head of the tribe for a year. The next year a different major maakua and a different ko'oi were in office, and the third year the third major maakua and ko'oi took charge …” (Hogbin, 1934, pp. 166-168)","hogbin1934[93-94, 166-168]"

17704,bukidnon,84,2,149-2,"Bukidnon villages had headmen (called dato) who administered justice. Datos also existed at the level of the ‘district’ or ‘region’, though these ‘head datos’ do not appear to have had much control over the local leaders (the only function they are described as having is judging cases that local datos could not settle). The role of dato was to some extent religious - they were protected by spirits who ‘aided them in their duties’, and the village datos, at least, are described as having been 'important functionaries in the ceremonies':

""The datos claimed the special protection of a group of spirits – Omalágad, Pamahándi, Tomanod, Molin-olin and Ibabasó – who aided them in their duties. The datos were important functionaries in in the ceremonies and were judges in all matters of dispute. If the case was a difficult one, the dato called in the headmen of the region and discussed it with them, and it is said that at times the dispute might go to the head dato. The procedure in a case is described as follows. The evidence was heard and a penalty assessed. Then the culprit and the accuser were directed to take hold of the ends of a piece of rattan, while the dato besought the spirits to watch. Next he directed the accused person to cut through the rattan with a single blow of his bolo (knife). If he failed it was a sign that he still had an evil mind and was unrepentant and deserving of additional punishment. If he succeeded the accuser was directed to cut the rattan. Failure on his part indicated that he was not satisfied with the judgement and ultimately would avenge himself.

""When the datos were assured that justice had been done, they directed the two parties to exchange head-cloths as a sign that they agreed with the verdict. This done, the dato took the rattan and holding it in his hands addressed the Magbabaya, gimokod and other spirits, asking them to take notice that the parties had accepted the judgement and invoking their aid in punishing whichever one might break his promises."" (Cole, 1956, pp 79-80)

However, ‘most’ religious ritual was performed by the baylans. According to Cole the baylans ‘do not form a priesthood’, although it is not entirely clear what this means. They are described as ‘officiating’ at ‘major events when the spirits are summoned’:

""Most traffic with the spirit world is through or with the aid of the baylans - a group of men or women who claim the ability to discover the cause of sickness. They also know how to conduct ceremonies acceptable to the spirits ... The baylans do not form a priesthood, although they are a definite group. Should one of them be visiting in a village where a ceremony is in progress he or she assists as a matter of course."" (Cole, 1956, p 89)

“The baylans must conduct the Kaliga-ōn ceremony and they usually officiate at all major events where the spirits are summoned. (However, minor offerings may be made by anyone ‘who knows how to talk to the spirits’).” (Cole, 1956, p 90)

There were multiple baylans in a settlement (Cole, 1956, p 91) but one may have been supreme – there is mention of the ‘ranking baylan’ of one settlement (p 93).

Of the ceremonies described by Cole (1956, pp 99-117), all but one appear to have been performed for individuals or for families. Only one (the pagampo) appears to have been observed at the village level, and this is the only description of a ceremony in which the dato is mentioned at all (all the ceremonies described involve baylans):

""PANGAMPO ... This is a community affair when an epidemic, such as smallpox, threatens; or when locusts invade the area or other disasters seem imminent. The headman (dato or presidente) summons all the people to a general meeting. The danger is stated and a day is set when all will assemble, each bearing gifts for the spirits whose help is sought ... All the people of the village gather around while the baylans call first to the gimokod of the dead, then to the Mabgabaya and the Alabyanon and especially to Bulalakau, god of the water."" (Cole, 1956, p 99)

The relationship between the dato and the baylans is not quite clear.

Both Pohnpei and Yap had cultic centers dedicated to different gods and attended to by hierarchical colleges of priests. Kosrae is different, however, because of the supporting relationship between the rural priesthoods, the centralized priesthood, and the centralized political structure. One has the impression that the pantheon of gods was an islandwide belief, with different priesthoods as the focus for a cult to one god or another within the pantheon. This is a striking contrast with the Pohnpeians high gods (enihwos), who were highly localized within different parts of the main island and whose cult was often limited to certain clans (Mauricio 1993, 467-483)."" (Dobbin, 2011, p 107)

“The earliest Western visitors to Kosrae – the French and Russian exploration ships la Coquille and the Senyavin in 1824 and 1827, respectively … described the island as politically unified with a population of no more than 3,000 people, which was divided into four distinct social strata. At the top was the paramount chief, who was both the secular and sacred head of Kosraean society and who held ultimate title to all land. Under the paramount there were about ten high chiefs, usually male relatives that were appointed by him. The high chiefs, who were obligated to live in Lelu with the paramount, controlled named land units called facl that ran from the high mountains to the reef. There were about fifty such facl  in Kosrae … Below the high chiefs were forty or fifty low chiefs who were land managers or overseers of the facl and who resided on the land for which they were responsible. Agricultural production was primarily the responsibility of the commoners, who occupied the lowest social strata. Low chiefs saw to it that needed food, labor, and tribute were provided to the paramount and high chiefs in Lelu.” (Athens, 2007, p 262)",dobbin2011[107];athens2007[262]

Munro says that Kedang was originally a radjadom, but M.A. Sarabiti, the last Kapitan, told me that his family bore only the Kedangese designation Rian-Baraq, an honorific composed of the words 'great' and 'heavy'.

But there had been strong mixture with foreigners, particularly with traders from Celebes, Adonara, and Alor ... [12] ... The contact with strangers gave Kalikur an advantageous sophistication and knowledge of the outer world; their position as intermediaries for the trade with the mountain population gave them power and wealth. They took advantage of this position to establish an arrogant and extortionate supremacy over the rest of Kedang ... The relation to the outside provided Kalikur its first opportunity to attempt serious conquest. No more than the incident just described can these event be dated, but they certainly belong to the second half of the nineteenth century ... Kalikur brought a party of meo or Timorese warriors to Kedang to help in suppressing the villages of the interior.

19265,ontong-java,85,3,151-3,"The people of Ontong Java were divided into two 'tribes', each of which occupied multiple villages and consisted of many 'joint families':

“The people are divided into two tribes. The members of one tribe, the less important both socially and numerically, own the part of the atoll near the island of Pelau, while the members of the other own all the remaining islands. Each tribe has its main village, one situated on Pelau island and [94] one on Luangiua. They have no distinguishing native names, but it will be convenient to call each after its own island.

“Each tribe is made up of a number of joint families, groups of individuals who are closely related. The joint family forms a compact unit, for it is practically autonomous, and the members own land and property jointly. Other economic units are the canoe-owning group, the house-owning group, the gardening group and the household. The tribe as a whole combines only to carry out religious ceremonies, the most important of which centre around the sanga rites, performed for one month of every year. Each tribe has a temple in its main village, and here ceremonies were formerly carried out daily by the priests.” (Hogbin, 1939, pp. 93-94)

'Religious institutions’ (Hogbin, 1934, pp. 166-168)

‘The legal system’ (Hogbin, 1934, pp. 210-231)

Religious authority at the tribal level was in the hands of priests (maakua or ali'i). These priests were also the headmen of joint families, though not all such headmen were priests:

“OUR examination of the culture of Ontong Java has so far been confined to the relations between each individual and members of certain limited groups, which might be called primary groups, since, as we have shown, the members co-operate with one another practically all the time … But each of these primary groups represents only a small portion of the community ... We now have to investigate how order was maintained within the society as a whole, or what were the forces regulating the relations of any individual towards members of primary groups to which he did not belong. For this purpose we must investigate the activities in which the whole tribe takes part.

“These activities consist almost entirely in religious ceremonies. These are mainly concerned with the priests, of whom I shall speak by their native name of maakua or ali'i. The [167] Luangiua tribe had eight maakua. The position of headman
in the joint families of the islands of Keila, Kepae, Kiloma, Kemalu, Akaha, Oko, and Keuolei carried with it the office of priest; that is to say, the headman of these groups were also maakua. The eighth maakua was the next senior man after the headman in the Kemalu joint family. Two members of this group were, therefore, maakua … The three maakua of Keila, Kepae and Kiloma may be distinguished from the other five. They had no special native name, but it will be convenient to speak of them as the major maakua. Each major maakua had an executive officer, his ka'ala. This man was either his sister's son or a man so classified. The two maakua of Akaha and Oko had special duties and had the additional title of ko'oi.' The remaining three, the two of Kemalu and the one of Keuolei, we will speak of as the minor maakua.

“The Pelau tribe had six maakua. Three of these were major maakua and three were ko'oi, there being no minor maakua.
To-day there are no maakua. The last died in 1925, more than two years before I first visited the atoll. It was consequently not possible to get information concerning them at first hand, and I had to rely entirely upon what other people told me.
Every year the whole Luangiua tribe came to their main village to celebrate a festival known as sanga. The festival lasted a month, on every day of which a different ceremony had to be performed. The maakua directed these ceremonies. When the last one had been carried out to its conclusion [168] all but one major maakua and one ko'oi returned to their islands. After they had departed any of the other people who wished were free to return also, though if they preferred to do so they remained on the main island. 

“Until twelve lunar months had passed, when the time for sanga came round again, the major maakua who had been left at Luangiua acted as the religious head of the tribe. Assisted by the ko'oi, he performed certain ceremonies every day to make the coconut and taro crops of the whole tribe flourish and to make the fish in the lagoon plentiful. After the next sanga these two maakua were replaced by two others, a major maakua and the other ko'oi. The following year the third major maakua held office and was assisted by the first ko'oi, and so it went on in regular rotation. 

“Pelau also had its sanga, identical in most respects with sanga at Luangiua. After the festival had concluded there, one major maakua, assisted by a ko'oi, acted as religious head of the tribe for a year. The next year a different major maakua and a different ko'oi were in office, and the third year the third major maakua and ko'oi took charge …” (Hogbin, 1934, pp. 166-168)

‘The earlier judicial system’ (Hogbin, 1934, pp. 210-211)

Prior to the establishment of the 'kingship', the maakua also had the right to appoint the polepole, who were the only other tribal functionaries. The role of the polepole was to prevent theft of coconuts from public lands, and to punish thieves. After the kingship was established, polepole were appointed by the king:
 
“If crime is defined as a specific act which is punished by society, either collectively or through its officers, we may say that in those days there was only one crime. This was the theft of coconuts from the common property or of taro from the swamps situated thereon.

“The malae was limited on the north by a broad path running right across the island from shore to shore. At either end stood a building, the hale-'api. These were the houses of the polepole,' officers whose duty it was to prevent trespass on the common land and to carry out punishment on any person they discovered doing so. These polepole were appointed by the maakua and, in later days, by the king. There were about fifty of them, and they took it in [211] turns to keep a lookout. The koko'a (literally, door), almost always a member of the joint family of one or other of the major maakua, acted as their head.

“When a person was found on the common land without good excuse he was brought before the koko'a. Criminals were punished for a first offence by having their heads shaved, but a second offence led to something more serious, either exposure naked in the sun without food or water for some time, or more frequently, death … Unfortunately not possible to give details of the judicial procedure because there are to-day no polepole. It is, nevertheless, quite certain that theft from the common property did almost inevitably lead to punishment if it was discovered.” (Hogbin, 1934, pp 210-211)

Establishment of the kingship:

“Some eight generations ago, so the tradition runs, a man named Ke hangamea organized a body of supporters into a sort of army. With the assistance of these men he set himself up as head of the Luangiua tribe and compelled all to obey him … This led to a good deal of unrest, and he was eventually murdered. Despite the end of his career, his example fired other men, and for a number of years a series of battles took place between claimants for the position. After perhaps three generations it was secured by ‘Avi’o, and descendants of his have held it ever since … The holder of the position of the head of the tribe will be spoken of as the king .His native title is heku'u, a word without any other meaning that I could discover … As time went on the kings acquired more and more power. The most powerful of them began to reign about 1878, a few years after the massacre of the crew of the first European ship to enter the lagoon. This was King Uila. He died in 1905 and was followed by Ke aepea, who lived till 1915. (Hogbin, 1934, p 224)

""The Pelau tribe has followed the Luangiua tribe in practically every detail. A kingdom was established in Pelau village at much the same time that ‘Avi’o established himself at Luangiua. In course of time the kings modified the rights of private vengeance, and the present king, Pongavalo, is the president of a court which closely resembles that of Mekaike."" (Hogbin, 1934, p 231)

‘Cases of judicial action by the king’ (Hogbin, 1934, pp. 225-229)

The role of the king appears to have been primarily that of arbitration. There is no indication that he played any religious role, or that he had any direct authority over the maakua. 

“As the king became more and more powerful a change came about: the idea of the king's peace was created. In the times of the early kings the change did not progress very far. Perhaps the only noticeable difference then was the additional security which the relatives of the king enjoyed. Nevertheless, there are several recorded instances of these kings banishing relatives and cutting them off from the privileges of the joint family, because they had wantonly abused the position which their relationship gave them by committing such acts as rape and murder.

“In the reign of Ke ulaho, the predecessor of Uila, the change had progressed so far that we hear of persons laying complaints against offenders before him and asking for his help to secure compensation or revenge. The important groups still kept matters in their own hands and settled their quarrels without assistance, but Ke ulaho on two or three occasions seems to have arranged matters so that a wronged husband had the right of retaliation on his wife's lover without any fear of a counter attack from his relatives. This king also kept his own relatives in check so that they did not take advantage of their relationship.” (Hogbin, 1934, p. 225)","hogbin1934[93-94, 166-168, 210-231]"

17718,Varisi,86,0,150-0,"The only political leader mentioned by Scheffler is the batu. The position of batu does not quite meet the definition of an office (‘a standardised set of duties and privileges devolving upon a person in a certain situation’, Hughes, 1937). Ideally, authority was vested in the batu unuma pua, whose status was ascribed, but often it was exercised by the batu sokele, who had achieved his status. The former had a right to ‘deferential treatment’ but not to leadership (though he did have a competitive advantage should he wish to compete for leadership). It is not clear that he had any duties.

""Each descent group is said to have a batu, big-man or manager, who is its principal leader. According to the dogmas, managerial status ‘crosses’ from father to elder son. However, a group may contain several men who are spoken of as batu and still others, adult, able-bodied men, with families, who are called kazigarata. All these men, regardless of their descent statuses have a right to a voice in group affairs, yet some are entitled to a ‘stronger’ voice than others …[180] ... The man who meets the genealogical qualifications of primogeniture and agnatic status is known as the 'true batu' or the batu 'who originates in the land' (batu ununua pua). Others are batu sokele, with the implication that they are ‘almost but not quite’ true batu. Thus batu implies not only formal qualifications but also behavioural attributes … A batu in the fullest sense, then, is one who meets both genealogical and practical qualifications."" (Scheffler, 1965, pp. 179-180)

""Prestige was accorded to men and groups who were successful in the most important intergroup activities, such as vengeance warfare and gift exchange … Each manager had to demonstrate his own worth before and while ‘in office.’ If he did not he would find himself gradually superseded by another who had earned the favour of descent-group members. The Choiseulese say that in effect the ‘people’ sometimes chose their manager by ‘discussion’ (vatovato), a term which is also applied to the more or less formal discussion of particular issues among descent group members. To make someone a batu was to va batua, but there were no formal ceremonies of installation. Therefore, recognition as a manager, and even as the manager, came about gradually and informally; it was the product of a gradually developed understanding within the descent group. It is said that the people would discuss the matter informally, come to a consensus, and then eventually appoint one of their number to communicate to the chosen party their wish for him to be their manager, but consensus sometimes probably came after the assumption of political predominance within the group.

""[183] Becoming a manager was essentially a process of acquiring wealth and a reliable following … A man who did this without meeting the formal genealogical qualifications was known as a batu sokele, but as long as there was no serious contender with better formal qualifications as well as the pragmatic ones, a batu sokele could operate as though he were the manager in the fullest sense. There are cases even today in which a man who is a nonagnate is generally recognized as a manager even though there are men more fully qualified in the formal sense. I was told that in the past both men would have been given deferential treatment but the formally qualified individual would have been only the titular leader while the people would have depended on the batu sokele for true leadership. Ideally, both men should have cooperated in the interests of the group as a whole. Informants differed about the consequences of such a situation for future succession: Some maintained that the son of the ‘true’ manager would be the next one, others felt that the son of the batu sokele, or some other man, would succeed him. It will become apparent that either could happen, but formal and de facto status as manager would hardly have remained separate for long in the indigenous situation.""

17731,eastern-toraja,86,2,150-2,"For the most part, the Eastern Toraja lived in independent villages. One or two of the Eastern Toraja ‘tribes’ (of which there were between twenty and twenty-five and which consisted of multiple villages) had a ‘paramount chief’ who appears, however, to have had no authority beyond collecting tribute for his non-Toraja overlord:

""The various tribes did not form organized political units ... There was little feeling of solidarity between tribes, except in instances where the memory of a common origin was recent enough to keep them on friendly terms ... [4] ... The tribes did, however, recognize a higher authority in the rulers of the kingdoms of Luwu and Mori. The To Pada and To Pakambia (those to the east of the Jaentu River, at any rate - those to the west of it sometimes recognized Mori and sometimes Luwu) came under Mori and the rest under Luwu. Of the two the more important was the datu of Luwu, the datu ri tana of Mori having formerly been his vassal (I, 119, 129ff., 60). His authority was, to be sure, only nominal according to western standards, as he merely required a small tribute in goods every once in a while - usually at intervals of more than a year, and contributions of buffalo for court feasts. He did, however, also call on his subjects from time to time for help in wars against other kingdoms, which the Toradja were usually quite ready to provide ... The datu of Luwu gave the title of karadja or tongko (called mokole by the Toradja) to the village chiefs of Tamungku (Pebato), Towale (Wingke-mposo), Pantjawu-enu (Lamusa) and Tando-mbeaga (Onda’e) with the duty of collecting tribute and transmitting it to him (I, 118). It was said that the To Onda’e, alone of these tribes, had had a paramount chief before the karadja was appointed by Luwu, though there is no proof of this, the whole institution possibly having been evolved under the influence of Luwu. The karadja of Onda’e came originally, according to tradition, from the village of Kodja, but their seat at the end of the last century was Tando-mbeaga. The rest of the Onda’e villages considered themselves more or less subject to it, and among other things they helped build the temple there, which was particularly large and handsome ... [5] ....Although Kruyt said that the To Onda’e were the only tribe having a paramount chief, he spoke elsewhere of 'the chief of the To Pada', and since they apparently had only one temple for the whole tribe, at Perere, it is possible that this held for them as well (Kruyt, 1907; 870; 1899b; 207).

""The most important unit of the tribe was the village ... They were widely separated, but the members of a single tribe saw to it that their villages were still close enough together so that they could hear each other’s drums in case of need ... [6] ... Toradja society was divided into two classes, slave and free. The former were called watua , the latter kabosenja . Kabosenja means “the great one(s)” and was also used for the heads of families and for the village chief (I, 113) ... The position of the village chief (kabosenja) was not hereditary. The man who best combined the qualities of courage, eloquence, generosity, organizational talent and resoluteness was accepted as such. When a chief began to get old he was not immediately replaced, but was helped by a younger man who gradually took over his duties and usually replaced him when he became too old or died (I, 114). The chief did not rule; his job was to consult with the family heads on matters which concerned the village as a whole. He did not give orders, but could only persuade (I, 115). Although the chiefs had no authority outside their own villages occasionally one of them distinguished himself by particular personal qualities and thereby enjoyed a certain degree of influence over several neighboring villages (I, 117f.).” (Downs, 1956, pp. 3-7)

More detail:

“The society of the Bare’e-speaking Toradja knew only two social standings: free and slave. The standing of the free was indicated with kabosenja . Originally the house fathers, heads of families were referred to by this name, which means ‘the great.’ The council of house fathers, which met in order to discuss and decide village matters, is called wa’a ngkabosenja ‘the whole body of house-fathers’; but if one speaks simply of the kabosenja, this means the village chief, who bore the title of kapala after the arrival of the Government … As has already been mentioned, the family heads come together in order to deliberate on village matters and to make decisions. This takes place under the leadership and in the house of the one among them who is recognized by all as the most prominent, the Chief, the kabosenja. Everyone expresses his opinion on the matter in question, and when the Chief learns all the thoughts on the matter, he draws a conclusion from them. His whole function is characterized by the above. The Chief has nothing to do other than to carry out the will of his fellow villagers. The authority of the Chiefs was therefore the opposite of absolute; one cannot imagine more constitutional rulers than these Chiefs. The more conservative they were, the better they upheld the manners and customs of the ancestors, the higher their prestige. The Chief is therefore the adat personified, who decides the way each of his fellow villagers would decide, and who can always justify himself by appealing to the common law.” (Adriani & Kruyt, 1950, pp 167-168)",downs1956[3-7];adriani-kruyt1950[167-168]

""First and foremost an adat -community denotes an autonomous political unit which inhabits a territory of its own and has its own adat, or system of customs. Furthermore one or more rituals are celebrated collectively by all members of a given adat-community. These rituals resemble to a considerable degree the rituals celebrated in other similar communities in what is known today as Tana Toraja, Yet, there are many local variants which, on occasion, deviate from more common patterns of observance.

“Every community has its own sacral artefacts ... The sacral artefacts are preserved in adat -houses (tongkonan), several of which exist in any adat-community ... Every tongkonan is the center of a specific ramage or subramage. The tongkonan was founded in the past by a leading ancestor of this marapuan or rapu and has since remained its social and religious center.

“As a ramage expands it eventually undergoes segmentation. The separating subramage then builds itself a new tongkonan which, being of later origin, is of lower status. It remains, however, the tongkonan of the leading ramage (or ramages) which lends distinction to the territory as a whole. The history of the leading (sub)ramage is closely intertwined with the history of the adat-community as such. A number of important subramages can reside in an adat-community in addition to the leading one itself. More often than not these are blood relatives of the leading subramage. Furthermore, within the territorial bounds of the community families from the lower classes will also make their homes here.

“[60] Not only eminent ramages, but also other families as well, often have a title. The leading family has the most significant title. Titleholders each have a specific area of competence and a concomitant role to perform in ritual. Functionaries also come together on the occasion of meetings, for councils concerning war and peace. One of the titleholders (a man belonging to the most important family) is primus inter pares. His voice is usually decisive in settling legal disputes.

“The Toraja language has no word for denoting the concept of adat-community in general: instead they differentiate a certain rank list of communities according to size and rank. In order of ascending magnitude, adat -communities are considered to belong to one of the following four categories:

“bua’ — or penanian (the bua’ -areas, see IV.1.2); patang penanian (see IV.1.4); lembang (see IV.1.4); tallulembangna (see IV.1.7).

“The village as a unit will be discussed in a separate section of the text (IV.2). Although it encompasses a territory in the traditional sense of the word, it differs in some ways from the bua’-, patang penanian- or lembang -communities. The village, moreover, often coincides with a bua’-community (it can also include two bua’-groups; on the other hand several villages together may constitute a single bua’ -community) ... A single bua’ -community includes a territorial area within which the inhabitants celebrate the bua’ padang -ritual together  ...[61] ... This ritual is a kind of agricultural New Year celebration with the aim of imploring the higher powers to smile on man, beast and the produce of the fields (in this instance, rice). The word penanian originally had a different meaning, for it is derived from nani (‘to sing’); it signified the performance of choral song during the above-mentioned bua’ -ritual. The term penanian is synonymous with bua’ -circle; it merely depends on what area or village a person lives in which of the two terms he will happen to use.

""Here, since the bua’ -feast will be described at length elsewhere (see Vol. II), I will limit my remarks about the celebration. It should be indicated, however, that the small bua’ -ritual ( bua’ padang ) must not be confused with the great bua’ -feast, the bua’ - or la’pa’ kasalle .

“We noted that a bua’ -unit can encompass half of a village, a whole one or several villages together. As opposed to the lembang, a bua’ seldom has a proper name, although people sometimes refer to it by the name of the relevant village (especially where bua’ and village coincide).
	
“Although I described the bua’-ritual above as a kind of agricultural New Year celebration, this does not mean that the bua’ padang was ever held annually ... Rather, celebration was performed on a rotation basis: village A, constituting a bua’-circle, observed the bua’ padang one year, village B (another bua’-circle) followed suit the next, village C (with bua’-circle C thus) enacted the ritual the third year, etc. ... A patang penanian is a federation composed of four penanian or bua’ -units (patang = four) which, apparently, celebrate the bua’ padang -feast in keeping with a cyclical arrangement like that described immediately above. Members of such a federation make up a larger administrative whole, larger than their own bua’ -group. The whole is also more than the sum of its parts, for there is an adat-chief for the patang penanian as an entity ... [62] ... The members of a patang penanian observe an important ritual together, such as, for example, a merok -feast or a great bua’-feast, the bua’- or la’pa’kasalle ... A patang penanian can itself be in turn part of a larger federal union, or even of a state. Thus La’bo’, a patang penanian consisting of four villages (= four penanian ), Mengke’pe, Marante, Tandung and Karatuan, is itself a member of the federation of Kesu’.

“There are also penanian -federations in the princedoms of Sangalla’ and Ma’kale. In the former the bond has the form of a patang penanian; in the latter, two forms of union are found, the karua penanian (‘the eight penanian’ ) and sangpulo dua penanian (‘the twenty-two penanian’ ). The eight members of the karua penanian are all situated in or near the village of Lemo; the twenty-two members of the other league are all clustered in the vicinity of Awa. It is not apparent to me how these smaller federations function in the context of larger socio-political units ...Lembang means proa or ship. The term is also used to denote a territory of varying compass … In these pages I will only use the word to denote an adat -community governed by a single set of laws, a group of people inhabiting a certain territory of larger dimensions than a bua’ or [Page 63] penanian . Such usage is well-founded on Toraja tradition which refers to the three puang -states of Tana Toraja as the Tallulembangna (‘the three lembang ’).

“During Dutch rule, such a traditional territory was usually made into an administrative district. As a rule such a lembang can be described as a federation of different bua’ -circles or of  various tondok (‘villages’). Three to nine bua’ usually constitute a lembang but the number can rise. Every lembang has a leader, an indo’ lembang or ma’dika lembang . Some lembang are princedoms under a puang.” (Nooy-Palm, 1979, pp. 59-63)

“H.T. Lanting in his ‘Nota’ of 1926 has left an intriguing speculative essay on the origin and evolution of social organization higher than the tongkonan. Befitting the diversity of the Sa’dan highlands, levels of social organization varied widely, as did the names for forms that were often quite similar. He distinguished five levels of social organization above the tongkonan, in order of ascending complexity. The first was the federation of tongkonan, which he also called merok communities (geemenschap), after the cycle of ceremonies by that name. [13] Each tongkonan within the community was under a tomakaka or to sugi’, none of whom assumed a position of authority for the entire federation; it was thus a purely horizontal organization of equals. The second level, the bua’, was a federation of tongkonan in which a federation leader emerged. The third level was a federation of bua’ which, like the tongkonan federation, did not acknowledge a single head. The fourth level was the lembang, a federation of bua’ in which a ruling head emerged. Finally, there was a federation of lembang, again with no acknowledged head. The only example of this last level in the Sa’dan highlands was the Tallu Lembangna (three lembang) of Ma’kale-Sangalla’-Mengkendek in the southern Sa’dan highlands.” (Bigalke, 2005, pp 11-13)",nooy-palm1979[58-92];bigalke-2005[11-13]

""By comparison, Berawan society is small in scale, relatively egalitarian, and composed of just four autonomous ritual and political units - the separate longhouse communities.""(Huntington & Metcalf, 1979, pp 133-134)

‘Prestigious men’ appear to have served as the main political and religiousl leaders (they directed mortuary rites, nulang, described as the ‘central’ component of Berawan religion). There appears to have been only one ‘outstandingly prestigious’ man in each community. However, this does not appear to have been an office in the sense of ‘a standardized group of duties and privileges devolving upon a person in certain defined situations’ (Hughes, 1937). Rather than the right to organise a nulang being vested in the role of ‘prestigious man’, organising nulang led to recognition as a prestigious man. 

""In each longhouse, one family apartment is designated as that of the chiefly family, the former residence of the last outstandingly prestigious man of the community."" (Huntington & Metcalf, 1979, p 133)

""There are many reasons, ideological, symbolic and social, why mortuary rites are central to Berawan religion and society. But it is not hard to see why they are utilized by leaders in order to make a statement about their own positions. Weddings and other rites of passage also provide an opportunity for community cooperation and conspicuous consumption. The Kenyah, close neighbours of the Berawan, employ name-giving ceremonies as their most important ritual of prestige. But the Kenyah have a more rigid system of prescribed rank than the Berawan, including endogamous class strata. For them it is possible to specify the status of a child in a way that is not for the Berawan ... the Berawan have no naming ceremonies comparable to Kenyah ones. They do appreciate the status implications of grand weddings. But when all the rice wine has been drunk, and the guests have shakily made their way home, what is there to keep a wedding in mind, to preserve it against the envious denigrations of rivals? The Berawan require something more concrete, and it is mortuary rites that provide it. Mausoleums are always built on the riverbank so that passersby can admire them and wonder at the power of their architects.

""At the outset, we noted that only people of high rank can command the support required to conduct a nulang or build a mausoleum. But we found it hard to define what rank is. We can now offer that definition by turning the original statement on its head. Berawan rank is, in part, the product of personal abilities: That person who can fuse the community together in coordinated action, that person is an aristocrat.""

Chapter on adat (custom) (Collins, 1979, pp 152-223) overwhelmingly emphasises the ‘ritual centrality’ of the jurai tue in maintaining good relations between the living and their poyang (ancestors):

“The traditional ritual centrality of the jurai tue which is represented in the location of his house, and the traditional prominence of the jurai tue in the social hierarchy which is represented in the three floor levels of his home have also undergone change.” (Collins, 1979, p 178)

“Mat Nur explained to us that according to Besemah adat a village was normally divided into four jungut and that each jungut had its poyang and its own pemipin (head, leader) who could be called the jurai tue of the jungut. But, Mat Nur went on, the real jurai tue of the village as a whole, stood outside the jungut and was not a member of any of them. The true jurai tue, Mat Nur explained, descended from the single founding ancestor of the village, the pangkal (beginning, source, root) down a straight line from eldest son to eldest son. The jurai tue was the anak yang tertue (the eldest child), Mat Nur emphasized, and he alone received the hak waris poyang (right of inheritance from the ancestor) which was a hak mutlak (absolute, unconditional right). The anak tertue, said Mat Nur, became a jurai tue not because he was believed in nor because he was elected like the pasirah nor because he had an inspiration like a dukun (healer, shaman), but because of his keturunan (descent).” (Collins, 1979, p 183)

""The feature of the jurai tue which seemed to be central both in Haji Mat Nur’s description and in the picture drawn for me by most informants is that he is the wakil (agent, deputy, representative). Although no informant volunteered to go on and specify who had deputized the wakil or on whose behalf he was the agent, it is clear from what people said about the jurai tue’s ideal role in his community that he can really be understood both as representative of the poyang to the people and representative of the people to the poyang."" (Collins, 1979, p 196-197)

""Besides being considered able to draw on his knowledge of history to make authoritative pronouncements about the moral health of his community the jurai tue is also held to possess the most reliable accounts of village precendent and tradition which enables him to mediate quarrels and disputes and to organize village cooperation. The jurai tue, my informants would say, is invited to every sedekah performed in the village. No ritual, they claimed, would be complete or possible without his presence."" (Collins, 1979, p 199)

“The other way of looking at the jurai tue as the wakil or representative of the people to the poyang is made clear in what the Besemah consider to be another signal responsibility of the elder and that is to bewace (utter the invocation). The jurai tue, as we know, is supposed to have custody of the sacred pusake of the poyang, which are supposed to contain a potent isi (contents, inherent spiritual substance). The pusake is considered to exert a beneficial and protective influence upon the entire ramified line of descendants of the poyang with whom the pusake originated … Originally, my Besemah informants explained, these pusake could only berekat (be effective) if the adat ritual feasts for them were properly carried out. And that would require that the jurai tue utter the formulas and incantations – bewace – which would explain to the poyang the needs of his descendants.” (Collins, 1979, pp 200-201) 

Some of the more powerful jurai tue exercised authority over multiple villages:

""In the days before the Dutch invaded Besemah, he continued, the jurai tue of Keban Agung did not just take care of his own village but had the right to regulate and supervise twelve villages in the area of Sawah Batuan. In those days, Mat Nur said, the jurai tue were the leaders and their deliberations gave rise to the rules and laws … which kept Besemah secure, calm and orderly and in accord with the aturan (order) Atong Bungsu established for Jagat Besemah."" (Collins, 1979, p 186)

At least two other kinds of ritual specialist – dukun (the shaman or healer) and the ulubalang (‘sorcerer-warrior) also existed. Collins describes these as part of a chapter on ilmu (something like ‘magic’) (pp 224-287) and stresses the individualistic rather than communal nature of these specialities:

“In the last chapter we saw that the jurai tue in Besemah is credited with what is round-aboutly called kelebihan (something more). That kelebihan derives from the elder’s possession of powerful heirlooms and from his authoritative knowledge of history that enables him to play a central part in defining the adat which unifies his community. Now we will consider some other figures in Besemah society who are credited with a power something like the elder’s kelebihan but which is called ilmu. The point that I will be trying to make in this chapter is that, whereas the powers of the elder are recognized as ideally supporting community solidarity represented by adat and order, the ilmu powers of the dukun (shaman-healer) or the ulubalang (sorcerer-warrior) are understood to give expression to the centrifugal tendencies in society. The extreme of these centrifugal or self-interested strains in Besemah society which also stand in strong contrast to the ideal of adat and community will be illustrated in the next chapter by the ilmu-like powers that every man develops in order to obtain rezeki (his own advantage).” (Collins, 1979, p 226)",collins1979
17693,landdayak,86,2,150-2,"“Sarawak Land Dayak villages are relatively large, a population 600 or more being not uncommon (Leach 1950: 66ff.). Nowadays, villages are located near streams, although in former times fortified settlements on hills seem to have been more common. There is a tendency to form village aggregates or clusters through a process of community fission (Geddes 1954). The village cluster appears to be the maximum socio-political unit. Hierarchies of chiefs, all with Malay titles, are found nowadays, but to what extent these are purely imposed offices is not known.” (Lebar, 1972, pp 195-196)

""The government of the Hill Dyaks, excepting in the chiefs, which rule over several tribes of the Sakarrans, resembles that of these latter people, and is of the most patriarchal character. The Orang Kaya, or chief, is elected by the people, though amongst tribes, tri- butary to the Malays, the Pafigeran, or Datta, to whom the tribe pays revenue, is always required, or arrogates to himself the right of confirming or rejecting the appointment. In large tribes, two Orang Kayas are frequently foumd : but the elder one has usually a slight pre-eminence. Others of the principal inhabitants of the village, are called ‘Panglimas,’ ‘Pangarahs,’ or fighting chiefs, and these are raised to their position on account of the courage and ability in war which they are supposed to possess. 

""The Orang Kaya does not appear to possess the slightest arbitrary power: the office is not hereditary, and the person filling it, is generally chosen on account of the wisdom and ability he displays in the councils of the tribe, and which appear to fit him for the duties of their representative in all their relations with their Malayan masters, or with the neighbouring villages ... [289] ...All affairs connected with the prosperity or welfare of the village, are discussed by a council of the men 
of the tribe, which is always held in the 'pangah,' and at which every male of the hamlet may be present, though seldom any but the opinions of the old men are advanced — the younger people paying great respect to the advice of the elders at this coun- cil. If the chief be a man of known and reputed ability, his opinion, which is generally given in a long and forcible oration, while the speaker is seated, and without much gesticulation, excepting the waving of the head, is of very great weight, and his arguments most frequently convince the assembly, unless some other opinion be advanced and supported with equal ability, when the approvers of each, in succession, address the 
members of this little parliament — a fair and impartial hearing being given to all — though the discussions are often protracted till near morning Ifrom the preceding dusk, when one party either yields its opinion to the other, or the minority is ompelled to give way — [290] these assemblies are never riotous, but always conducted in a quiet, grave, and business-like manner."" (Low, 1848, pp. 288-290)

“The Land Dayaks are anarchists to the extent that no one amongst them is strong enough to force the others to do anything which they do not wish to do. In their classless society there are no true chiefs. Each village has a headman, nowadays confirmed in office by the Government, but he leads only when the people agree to be led.” (Geddes, 1961, p 21)",lebar1972[195-196];low1848[21];geddes1961[21]

19743,kodi,86,0,150-0,"'The Kodi construction of the past' (Hoskins, 1997, pp. 29-169)

Kodi consists of a number of 'ancestral villages':

“These forty possessions are distributed among thirty-one ancestral villages, out of the total of sixty-six villages found in Kodi.” (Hoskins, 1997, p. 120)

Prior to the arrival of the Dutch, politics in Kodi and other parts of western Sumba is described as being a 'big man' system rather than one with centralized rule:

“Sumba at the beginning of the twentieth century was divided into about twenty indigenous domains. Those in the eastern part of the island were ruled by a single lord, usually [176] addressed as tamu umbu, who was the head of stratified, autocratic polity. In the western domains, no such centralized ruler existed; instead one found a shifting, achievement-oriented competition between ‘big men’ who established their power bases from ancestral villages but did not rule over their fellows.” (Hoskins, 1997, pp. 175-176)

""Since there was no Kodi 'king' before the colonial period, Horo's references to insults inflicted on the 'sacred power of traditional rulers' ... borrow an idiom of divine kingship that applied to other parts of Indonesia, but not to precolonial West Sumba. Despite its linguistic and ceremonial definition as a domain, Kodi's constitution as an independent polity was as imaginary as those historical fictions that first linked Indonesians into a single national community."" (Hoskins, 1997, p. 319)

There were 'priests', who appear to have solely religious functions, as well as leaders called rato katoda, who led headhunting raids against non-Kodi. Little detail is provided about the role of the rato katoda, but given the denial of centralized political authority in the excepts above, it seems likely that this role was temporary and/or informal.

“In Kodi, the polarity was established between the passive ritual authority of the rato marapu, the priest whose seclusion within the village protected the crops and the [56] rhythm of the seasons, and the rato katoda, the war leader who used his magical powers to raid neighboring peoples and appropriate their vitality for his own people. The competition for life and political power was played out between domains through the taking of heads and the capture of prisoners. The power of the Sea Worm Priest was centrifugal: it spiraled outward from him, the unmoving center that held together the round of seasons and agricultural activities. The power of the headhunting leader, by contrast, was centripetal: it turned inward to the center, bringing the trophy heads back into the domain and placing their fertile, vital energies at the disposition of the victors.” (Hoskins, 1997, pp. 55-56)

In 1909, 'elders' from all the ancestral villages of Kodi met to choose a leader (raja or toko) at the request of the Dutch:

""In 1909, when the Dutch took effective control of the island of Sumba, they asked the people of Kodi to choose a leader to serve as an administrator and representative to the colonial powers. This leader would be presented with the gold staff that created the colonial office of raja, the native administrator of each ‘self-governing region.’ A meeting of elders from all the ancestral villages was held in Tossi, in the Council House established by Rato Pokilo, and they agreed to choose this leader from the home of the urn, the most sacred object in the domain. Hence Rato Loghe Kanduyo, [128] a famous orator and warrior descended from Rato Pokilo, was selected to be the first raja, serving as a spokesman and mediator vis-à-vis outside forces. 

“His selection was legitimated by an argument involving the genders of the urn and the staff and the idea of complementarity … The male staff served as the ‘husband’ of the female urn. This symbolic marriage linked the two offices, making the representative of the Dutch colonial administration into the junior partner in a division of powers, since the holder of the staff (called the toko, the native term for raja, from the Indonesian tongkat) owed ritual deference to his senior, the priest of the sea worms.” (Hoskins, 1993, pp. 127-128)

The power and legitimacy of the rajas increased after the first rebelled against the Dutch:

""As an officer of the Netherlands East Indies government, the new raja was supposed to explain its civilizing mission to his people as well as provide labor for bridge- and road-building projects to improve communications. Two years later, in 1911, rumors circulated that Dutch soldiers had enslaved noblemen to work on these projects, insulted the raja, and raped a local woman. An armed rebellion began with the ambush and killing of four soldiers by headhunters from outlying villages, who fled 
into the forest with the guns captured from the soldiers. The  Dutch forces retaliated by burning the raja's village of Tossi, after which they took refuge with his rivals in another river valley.

""To avenge the burning of his village, the raja gave permission for military attacks to continue. He took the traditional symbols of governmental power-the urn and plate-off into the bush and hid them. Yet he did bring the Dutch staff of office with him when he rode, in a procession bringing gold and livestock, to meet the Dutch commander and negotiate a peace payment. Instead of talking to him, however, the commander pulled him from his horse, bound him under the house, and made him 
march to a distant prison, where he soon died. This brutal punishment of the first native ruler united almost all the population in opposition to the Dutch presence. Three years of fighting followed, with rebel forces hiding [129] in the interior and attacking the colonial army periodically. The Dutch, deciding to starve out their enemies, then forced everyone to move to coastal villages and leave their gardens behind. Finally, pressured by famine and hardship, the rebel forces surrendered and were sent into exile. 

""This first sequence of events shows the consequences of differences between local understandings of governmental power and those of the Dutch colonial forces. The Dutch expected to find rulers who could command the population and thus concentrated power and wealth in the man chosen as raja. By contrast, Kodi perceived the raja, at least initially, as a mediator and spokesman, who would speak for them in negotiations with outside forces but who had no authority to act without a meeting of elders from each village.

""The creation of a Kodi polity, and after that of a regional resistance movement, was one of the unintended consequences of the colonial encounter. Because no single ruler preceded them, the Dutch had to establish the legitimacy of the first Kodi raja themselves. Rato Loghe Kanduyo died in the process of his transformation into a raja, and his nephew Ndera Wulla made the first claims to a new and different form of political power ..."" (Hoskins, 1993, pp. 128-129)

With Indonesian independence, the office of raja was reduced to a merely ceremonial one:

“After independence, traditional rulers were left in ceremonial positions and respected, but virtually all power was taken from them: a new nationalist rhetoric asserted that because all of Indonesia was once a ‘village democracy,’ past hierarchies and inequalities were the creation of a ‘feudal’ colonial system and should be abolished."" (Hoskins, 1997, p. 132)

Kodi retained its status as an administrative unit but appears to have been fully incorporated into the Indonesian political system. The camat ('district head') could be Kodi (Hoskins, 1993, p. 164), but there seems to have been no requirement for this.",hoskins1997[29-169]

Orang kaya as officiant:

""At their feasts on less war-like occasions, their more powerful and good spirits are petitioned by prayer and supplication to be present; but as these festivals are intimately connected with their religious observances, I will in this place describe one which was made on my arrival at the village of the Sebongoh Hill Dyaks, in August, 1845, in honour of the first European visit to them. After having consented to remain while the chief collected the tribe, I sat down in the verandah of the house, which had been prepared for my reception by being covered with fine white Sirhassan mats : similar ones were also strewed from my boat to the houses, which are built on the banks of the river, so that I might not soil my feet in the ascent to them. Soon after I was seated, the Orang Kaya (chief of a village) requested me to give them a little piece of doth, and a small silver coin — they wishing to cut off the string of a pillow- [255] case for the first, but I gave them a grass-cloth hand- kerchief, which very much delighted them : the old chief brought out his wife to receive it, and the lady told me that it was to be hung up in the house as a memorial of my visit, and to preserve the village from evil influence.

""When the feast was about to begin— or rather the preparations for it — I was desired by the Orang Kaya to accompany him to the stage before the verandah, which is used by the Dyaks for dryiug their Padi (Indian-corn), Jagong (maize), &c. Having determined, for the purpose of seeing the ceremony, to be quite passive in their hands, I accordingly rose, and went with him. The old man held in his left hand a small saucer, filled with rice, which had been made yellow by a mixture with Kunyit, or Turmeric, and other herbs. He then uttered a prayer in Malay, which he had previously requested me to repeat after him. It was addressed to Tuppa, the sun and moon, and the Rajah of Sarawak, to request that the next Padi harvest might be abundant, that their families might be increased with male children, and that their pigs and fowls might be very prolific: it was, in fact, a prayer for general prosperity to the country and tribe."" (Low, 1848, pp. 254-255)

Alleged lack of religious specialists:

""The Land Dyaks have not among their tribes any of the peculiar functionaries described as ‘Manangs’ in the preceding chapters … The only person who appears amongst them to be professionally connected with their religious observances, is the ‘Balean,’ who prepares the piles for the burning of their dead, as these Dyaks do not dispose of their dead relations by burial."" (Low, 1848, p. 262)

'Priests' and 'priestesses':

""The priests must in many respects be regarded as impostors, though, of course, even with their deceitful practices is mixed much superstitious credulity. They pretend to meet and to converse with spirits, to receive warnings, and sometimes presents from them, to have the power of seeing and capturing the departed soul of a sick man, and to be able to find and secure for the Dayaks that vital principle of the rice which 'Tapa' sends down from above at their two chief harvest feasts ... For getting back a man's soul he receives six gallons of uncleaned rice; for extracting a spirit from a man’s body, the same fee, and for getting the soul of the rice at harvest feasts he receives three cups from every family in whose apartment he obtains it. The value of six gallons of uncleaned rice is not very great, but it is the sixtieth part of the amount obtained by an able-bodied man for his annual farm labour.

""The priestesses have their fees, but they do not make so much from the superstition of their country-men as the male professors."" (St. John, 1862, pp 201-202)

Priests, priestesses and manangs:

""It was generally believed that much of the serious sickness was caused by evil demons, who either wounded the patient internally, stayed in his body to work harm, or stole one of his seven souls which, combined, sustain his life ... Treatment could be had from three different classes of practitioner. The priests of the ancestral cult simply made offerings to the ancestors and to the demons, appealing to the demons to stop troubling the patient and to the ancestors to use their influence in seeing that they did. The priestesses of the women's cult appealed in the same way to their own set of deities and to the demons, but went one stage further in actually catching the patient's lost soul, usually in the form of a small stone snatched out of the air, and returning it to him. Finally, there were in Mentu Tapuh two persons termed manangs.

""The performances of the manangs were much more livelyy, making up in melodrama for their poorer sanction in tradition. These two practitioners diagnosed, prognosed, invoked deities, danced in semi-trance consulting their deities in person, derived power from special objects in their possession, demonstrated superhuman qualities, and caught souls. But the most important way in which they differed in their practice from the others was that they actually treated the patient, either by sucking or pulling the sickness out of him, or by using mysterious medicines, or both ... The leading manang - or spirit-medium, or shaman , or medicine-man, or witch-doctor, for he was all of these - was a man of about twenty-eight years old named Raseh."" (Geddes, 1961, pp xii-xiv)

Regarding a possible religious role for the orang kaya, the following suggests that this was not essential to the office:

“Anyone stands a chance of becoming headman, although a relative of a previous good leader stands a slightly better chance, not so much because of the relationship itself but because he has been more in the public eye … If he is a priest it is a further advantage because of his influence with the ancestors.” (Geddes, 1961, p 21)",geddes1961[21]

However, this source (Barton, 1938, pp. 111-114) does not add much to the information scattered throughout Barton (1946).

Most Ifugao men were priests, and rarely officited for anyone but their relatives. There were only two 'public rites', connected with 'rice ritual'. Speaking of the first settlers of the Ifugao region in the distant past, Barton writes:

""This expansive trend was, during the further history of the tribe, nursed along by conditions that developed in the new habitat. One of these was democratization of the priesthood. With the weakening of the tie of local solidarity, unrelated priests came to be objects of suspicion, and only priests connected by family ties were called on to perform the rituals. Nearly all the public ritual that abounds on the western side of the range, the great, fairly regularly recurring feasts of ward and town, was dropped with the exception of two rites, somewhat reduced in character, that occur once a year in connection with the rice ritual. The result was a great multiplication of priests. Whereas, according to Moss, the proportion of priests to people among the Nabaloi and Kankanai in Benguet towns is about 1 to 165, in central Ifugao every man of normal [24] intelligence and memory becomes a priest."" (Barton, 1946, pp 23-24). 

'Rice ritual' (1946, pp. 109-126)

It is not entirely clear which of the two ceremonies of the 'rice ritual' Barton was referring to on p. 23. However, one of the ceremonies (pokol) is described as having 'the nature of a general welfare feast' (p. 114), another (tuldag) appears to have involved taboos that bound every resident of a village (p. 122), and another (takdog) involved all the inhabitants of a 'valley':

“POKOL: May—June—Only by the rich on the night before harvest … This is one of the few agricultural rites to be performed at the house instead of at the granary. It partakes of the nature of a general welfare feast (honga).” (Barton, 1946, p. 114)

TULDAG: July—For the return of the’stolen’ rice. … When everybody’s rice is dry and ready to be stacked in the granary, a ritual idleness of three days is declared, during which nobody may leave the village. Each household that has a granary performs the tuldag.” (Barton, 1946, p. 122)

“TAKDOG: August.

“Whereas the foregoing rite is performed individually by all the households of a region that have granaries, the takdog is performed communally by the whole region at the house of the first planter, the montonak. Certain fields in each region, it should be explained, are by custom planted first, and the owner of those fields, the montonak, determines for the whole valley the time of spading, repairing the dikes and planting.

“In Central Ifugao, the takdog rite is preceded by a ceremonial idleness of three days. On the morning of the appointed day several atag mats are spread in a shady place in the village of the montonak, and the granary idols from all the granaries of the village are placed on them, together with the ritual chests (on top of which are piled clusters of betels) and any number of wine bowls ... This rite marks the ritual termination of the harvest and of the rice year.” (Barton, 1946, p. 123)

Lambrecht (1932-1941, pp. 729-754 ) provides a detailed description of priesthood among the Ifugao of Mayoyao.

General description of the role of priests:

""The sole function of Mayawyaw priests as such is to perform rites and sacrifices. They have neither authority nor prestige in Mayawyaw society by virtue of their priesthood alone, but the counsels of the most learned among them may prevail in religious matters that concern either the whole or a considerable part of the community or a particular family."" (Lambrecht, 1932-41, p. 729)

According to Lambrecht there was 'no real hierarchy' among the priests, but some priests were more 'famous' than others. The 'manu'ngaw' priest may be a partial exception:

""The priests do not form a collective body. They are not organized in a society. Each one of them goes his own way. No one of them is subordinated to another more famous priest. There is no real hierarchy among the priests. There are however a few among them who on account of their more comprehensive knowledge of the rites and sacrifices have great prestige above all ordinary priests in all matters concerning religion ..."" (Lambrecht, 1932-1941, p. 730)

""In the various rituals of the Mayawyaw we have seen that the great majority of the rites and sacrifices are performed for the advantage and upon the request of individuals and their families. All these can be performed by ordinary priests. But now and then we have encountered rites and sacrifices which were performed, not for one particular family, but for a group of different families, for a part [731] of the Mayawyaw community or for the whole community. Such are the Elewo′ng Sacrifice (Rr, 76-85), the Hi′gnup Sacrifice of the manu′ngaw priest (Rr, 154-58), the sacrifices offered at the burial of a beheaded Mayawyaw, or of a Mayawyaw who died a sudden death (Dr, 383-93; although they are done only for the advantage of one family they impose a tu′ngaw binding a part of or sometimes the whole community), the sacrifices offered after a war expedition (Dr, 461-76; they also impose a tu′ngaw binding others than the family of the nunggolo′t), the sacrifice offered in cases of epidemic (see Illness Ritual), and some other rites. Only the famous priests can perform these sacrifices and it is therefore quite natural that they have acquired great prestige.

""At present those famous priests are: Banni′ya, the manu′ngaw priest (he is the most famous, just because he appoints the general tu′ngaw binding the whole community: see Rr, 154-58), Mungko′lnon (our chief informant, China′pan (these three are the only priests who offer the Elewo′ng Sacrifice), Ama′won, Lacho′na, Changwa′djan, Chadja′-ot and a couple of others. This does not mean that these seven or eight famous priests are always the leading priests in sacrifices where several priests have been called to perform the rites (for instance, in the solemn Pa′hang and I′pad Sacrifices: see Mr, 211 ss.). It may well be an ordinary priest who leads the rites, even if one or more of the famous priests are present and have also been called to take an active part in the sacrifice. However it has been our experience that on such occasions these famous priests often make remarks and give suggestions to the other priests present and even to the priest who is taking the leading part in the rites, and that invariably their desires meet with no opposition."" (Lambrecht, 1932-1941, pp. 730-731)

More about the 'manu'ngaw priest' or 'rice chief', which Lambrecht goes as far as describing as 'the only authority among the Mayawywaw:

""“The day that the Manu′ngaw priest, or rice-chief, performs the hi′gnup-sacrifice for his own personal crop is the great rest-day of obligation for all the Mayawyaw under his jurisdiction. These are the people of the entire Mayawyaw valley, including the villages of Bo′ngan, Maya′wyaw, Ba′nhal, Cha′dja, Mapa′woy, Choma′ng, Bala′mbang and Lu-u′-an. The villages of Bunhi′yan and Cha′mag have each their own Manu′ngaw, although their customs and rites are said to be the same. The people of these two villages are said to be descendants of Mayawyaw ancestors. On the rest-day or tu′ngaw, in the strictest sense, is prohibited all work, such as gathering firewood and sweet potatoes, pounding rice, or harvesting ... [155] ... The Manu′ngaw priest is always an old man, and one too who is well-to-do or fairly rich. He is not allowed to leave his district. Thus, the Manu′ngaw of the Mayawyaw valley, on account of this personal taboo, never goes to the valleys of Bunhiyan or Damag, which are the districts of other Manu′ngaw, or a fortiori to other valleys not inhabited by Mayawyaw people. The Manu′ngaw priest is the only authority among the Mayawyaw and his power is exclusively that of indicating the tu′ngaw day. He may, however, enjoy much prestige, as he is an influential priest and a rich man.

""His selection or appointment is made by the other men of influence in the valley. This does not imply that there is a meeting of all those men for this purpose at one particular place or date. They just talk the matter over a little now and then, and inform the priest to whom their preferences go. They must, of course, select him from among those priests who know the special rites of the manu′ngaw function, or at least from among those most influential priests who would have no difficulty in learning these special rites if he does not already know them."" (Lambrecht, 1932-1941, pp. 154-155)

Conklin (1980) provides a more tractable account of Ifugao sociopolitical organization. According to Conklin, the Ifugao lived in hamlets (buble) grouped into districts (himputonā’an):

“All settlements (buble), districts (himputonā’an), and subdivisions of each are named. The several dozen hamlets of an average district lie dispersed within or near a clustered series of irrigated terraces and other holdings. Each district is defined by a single centrally located ritual rice field (puntonā’an), traditionally the first parcel to be planted and harvested … In cultural, social, technical and environmental terms, agricultural districts are both the largest and most functional territorial units in Ifugao … If one examines the 1970 population totals for the survey areas (NCI: 14,621 in 563 hamlets), for the region studied in detail (PKB: 2,275 in 90 of those hamlets) and for the focal district (B: 390 in 17 hamlets, the following comparisons can be made … ” (Conklin, 1980, p 6)

A few men within each hamlet served as ‘priests’:

“With its requisite offerings of rice beer, betel ingredients, ritual incantations (bā’i) – and frequent animal sacrifices to the ancestors, local spirits, and hundreds of gods – Ifugao ritual concerns all households … A few men in each community acquire sufficient knowledge and repute to serve as almost full-time ritualists or ‘priests’ (mumbā’i). Several rites are performed by women specialists (mama’o). Most adults participate in all major religious observances.” (Conklin, 1980, p 12)

The tomona’ (owner of the ritual field defining a particular agricultural district - presumably equivalent to the montonak described by Barton) had a degree of religious authority over the whole district, though if the owner was a woman this authority would be exercised by a male relative:

“Each district is defined by a single centrally located ritual rice field (puntonā’an), traditionally the first parcel to be planted and harvested. Its owner, the tomona’, makes all district wide agricultural decisions. He or she manages all ritual-field property, including a granary housing carved wooden guardian idols (būlūl), and the basket reliquary (panu būngan), in which portions of consecrated sacrifices from all agricultural first rites are kept.” (Conklin, 1980, p 6)

“For fields poorly supplied with water or structurally deficient, early planting … may take place a month ahead of the normal schedule with the permission of the tomona’, who may combine the role of main ritual parcel owner and district agricultural priest; if the owner is a woman, a close male relative performs the necessary rituals …” (Conklin, 1980, p 20)","lambrecht-1932-1941[154-155, 729-754];conklin1980[6]"

Priesthood:

""That the belief in spirits is the basis of Igorot religion is shown in the fact that each person or each household has the necessary power and knowledge to intercede with the anito. No class of persons has been differentiated for this function, excepting the limited one of the dream-appointed insupak or anito exorcists.

""That belief in a supreme being is a later development than the belief in spirits is clear when the fact is known that a differentiated class of persons has arisen whose duty it is to intercede with Lumawig for the people as a whole.

""This religious intercessor has few of the earmarks of a priest. He teaches no morals or ethics, no idea of future rewards or punishments, and he is not an idle, nonproductive member of the group. He usually receives for the consumption of his family the food employed in the ceremonies to Lumawig, but this would not sustain the family one week in the fifty-two. The term ‘priesthood’ is applied to these people for lack of a better one, and because its use is sufficiently accurate to serve the present purpose.

""There are three classes of persons who stand between the people and Lumawig, and to-day all hold an hereditary office. The first class is called ‘Wa-kü′,’ of which there are three men, namely, Fug-ku-so′, of ato Somowan, Fang-u-wa′, of ato Lowingan, and Cho-Iûg′, of ato Sigichan. The function of these men is to decide and announce the time of all rest days and ceremonials for the pueblo. These Wa-kü′ inform the old men of each ato, and they in turn announce the days to the ato … The title of the second class of intercessors is ‘Pa′-tay,’ of whom there are two in Bontoc—Kad-lo′-san, of ato Somowan, and Fi′-Iûg, of ato Longfoy. 

[206] ""The Pa′-tay illustrate the nature of the titles borne by all the intercessors. The title is the same as the name of the ceremony or one of the ceremonies which the person performs.
Once every new moon each Pa′-tay performs the pa′-tay ceremony in the sacred grove near the pueblo. This ceremony is for the general well-being of the pueblo.

""The third class of intercessors has duties of a two-fold nature. One is to allay the rain and wind storms, called ‘baguios,’ and to drive away the cold; and the other is to petition for conditions favorable to crops. There are seven of these men, and each has a distinct title. All are apparently of equal importance to the group."" (Jenks, 1905, pp. 205-206)

Settlement pattern:

""Bontoc and Samoki pueblos, in all essentials typical of pueblos in the Bontoc area, lie in the mountains in a roughly circular pocket called Pa-pas’-kan … Bontoc lies compactly built on a sloping piece of ground, roughly about half a mile square … [49] … Bontoc is composed of seventeen political divisions, called ‘a’-to’ … Each a’-to is a separate political division … The pueblo must be studied entirely through the a’-to. It is only [50] an aggregate of which the various a’-to are the units, and all the pueblo life there is is due to the similarity of interests of the several a’-to.""

18596,aneityum,86,3,150-3,"Settlement on Aneityum was dispersed. The island was divided into 'tribes' or 'chiefdoms', each of which consisted of a number of districts. Each tribe had a 'high chief' (natimarid), and each district had a 'district chief' (natimi alupas):

“As well as being responsive to population levels and structure, agriculture was organised within a social framework provided at contact by a stratified political system, reflected in a settlement hierarchy of chiefdoms or 'tribes' each divided into a number of districts. Each chiefdom had at its head a high chief (natimarid), with a number of petty or district chiefs (natimi alupas) subservient to him …The districts are the basic settlement unit with the households within them in a dispersed pattern among the gardens …” (Spriggs, 1981, p. 55)

The power of chiefs varied according to their personal qualities. Their most important role, and perhaps their only 'de jure' role, was to organize and provide feasts. The 'principal men' of a chiefdom, which included the natimi alupas and possibly others, also had a say in some chiefdom level decisions (notably choosing a new natimi arid):

“All early accounts agree as to the presence on the island of patrilineal hereditary chieftainship, tempered to some extent by the necessary approval of the 'principal men' of the group … When a successor to a natimarid was chosen these principal men would be the natimi alupas of the chiefdom  … Geddie and Inglis differed in their appreciation of the authority of the natimarid. Geddie used phrases such as 'supreme’, 'arbitrary power', 'greatly dreaded', 'viewed with a kind of religious veneration while they lived and worshipped . .. after death', 'almost absolute power, and ‘exercised their power with much rigour’ … Inglis on the other hand described their authority as [59] ‘very limited. Every man appears to do very much what is right in his own eyes'.  … These differing assessments may relate to the power-authority distinction: Inglis (ibid: item 44d) describes the northern natimarid present on his arrival as 'feeble' while those in Geddie's parish were 'men of influence and great force of character'.” (Spriggs, 1981, pp. 58-59)

“It is in the practice of feasting (so strongly condemned by the missionaries) that Aneityumese social structure and the position of chiefs is most clear. The central role of chiefs was in the giving and receiving of feasts, involving the appropriation of surplus food production in their own chiefdoms or districts and redistributing across chiefdom or district boundaries … A chief's relative status was shown by the quantity of food collected and this was limited by the quantity he could appropriate from his own subjects. One way of concentrating food supplies for the feasts was the imposition of a taboo on certain foods leading up to it, backed up by fear of angering the chief as possessor of malevolent powers, and of angering the spirits (natmas) in general. On occasions more directly coercive sanctions were employed to enforce taboos … [65] … this fear was tempered by an ideology of giving. Thus, 'it was one of the primary articles in the creed of heathenism, that the man who made the most costly offering to the natmasses, most effectually propitiated their favour' (App· 8: item 14) , and 'their highest ambition was to make a great exhibition of food' (ibid: item 12) … Within the district therefore, status could be assigned to the individual who produced the greatest quantity of food, successfully propitiating both chief and natmas. The chief carried this desire for status lo the inter-district arena, where an impressive display of food showed that his garden magic was more powerful therefore his propitiation of the natmas more successful, and his control over agricultural production more effective than his rivals.” (Spriggs, 1981, pp. 64-65)

One source describes a 'tribal council' which is not mentioned elsewhere. This council is destribed as punishing 'all infractions of tribal law'. Although the members of this council are described as being under the 'jurisdiction' of the natimarid, his exact role in it is not clear.

""The tribal council consisted of the head men of each village
or hamlet under the jurisdiction of each high chief. All infractions of tribal law were discussed, and punished by the arms being bound and the culprit left for several hours to the public gaze, also by his getting growing food uprooted to ·feed the council ...""

It is undoubtedly true that the accumulation and distribution of material wealth was crucial to the maintenance of big-man status in historical times- as the exploitation of trading contacts by Bera and others shows. However, in the head-hunting era in the western Solomons, status also depended a great deal upon success in warfare ... [67] ... The authority of these 19th century leaders was in many cases more absolute than that of the modern big-man. Although big-man leadership was usually limited to the village, with a large enough following a leader could command, through physical force, not only his own village but a district. Thus largely through the agency of head-hunting such men as Bera, Ingava and Gau extended their power.

““It is often stressed in the missionary accounts that the 'civil' role of chiefs was inextricably bound up with their 'sacred' role  (ioid: items 6, 8, 9, 22, 25, 30, 38, 44d, 45). Thus natimarid were described as 'high priests' or priest-sorcerers renowned as disease-makers, rain-makers, fish-makers, fruit and crop-makers, famine-makers and so on. Other priest-sorcerers, a 'numerous and influential' group, were usually also natimi alupas. The sorcerer's role was also a hereditary one (ibid: items 19b, 45), and Inglis went so far as to state that great warriors or disease-makers, 'being most dreaded, possessed greatest influence' … Chiefly power was thus based, as in many small-scale chiefdoms (cf. Godelier 1977: 201-2~ 1978: 767), on ritual rather than physically coercive powers - power of sorcery against enemies, power over the elements to control success in agriculture and fishing.

“There are various ways in which chiefs were distinguished from commoners. Only chiefs could regularly participate in kava ·drinking … and cannibalism was also a special prerogative of chiefs (ibid: items 27b, 44b). Polygamy was practised principally among the chiefs (ibid: items 18, 23), with three wives being the maximum number noted by the missionaries (Inglis, HR, Dec. 18.55: 182). Chiefs had some say (with family heads) in arranging marriages within their own chiefdoms or districts … and they themselves tended to intermarry with other chiefly families to extend alliances. Only natimarid had the right to be carried on men’s shoulders in ‘baskets’ on ceremonial occasions …  and their person was considered sacred … There were various ceremonies on the accession of a chief … and each chief had an area of sacred ground where rituals were performed … Inter-district and inter-chiefdom feasts, a central feature of Aneitymese social life, were given and received by the [60] chiefs (ibid: item 28, 44d).

17700,buka,84,0,149-0,"Blackwood (1935) provides a detailed description of ‘Magic and Medicine’ (pp 462-482), and various supernatural beliefs (pp 483-573). Nothing clearly identifiable as religious authority is mentioned. About magic specifically, Blackwood writes:

“Among the natives of North Bougainville, mana seems to belong not so much to the individual who performs the ritual acts as to the substance he uses. There are no persons set apart as ‘medicine men’ who have qualified for the post by long training or by undergoing ordeals. I am not aware of any word in these dialects which means a maker of magic, except in the case of black magic, which stands in a class by itself. Otherwise the distinction is between those who know the procedure and possess the requisite apparatus and those who do not. Thus, Sobak and Riamē were competent to act as rain-makers, Pinari was the specialist in dog magic, Minka in bonito magic, Pari in the treatment of sprains and broken bones, and so on. But Riamē could not make rain without his coco-nuts, nor Minka bring bonito without his stone fish. Again, in the description of the taro-garden ceremony given in Chapter IX it will be seen from incidents occurring in connexion with the proceedings that it did not greatly matter who actually took the principal part in washing the taro-stalks; the ēto [magical substance] was clearly regarded as the factor of primary importance.” (Blackwood, 1935, p 476)

On the other hand, the tsunaun (roughly, ‘chief’) played a ritual, though not necessarily religious, role – one of their functions was to organise ceremonies:

“Pinari, in his dual capacity of tsunaun and kukerai, claimed as much authority as he dared, and bitterly regretted that the rule of the white man had deprived him of the power of life and death. He adjudicated on disputed questions of all kinds, claimed to have a say in the marriages of the people under his jurisdiction, and arranged for the holding of all important ceremonies.” (Blackwood, 1935, p 50)

Tsunaun were often proficient in magic, but not necessarily:

""Although it may easily happen that a tsunaun is possessed of special knowledge of some particular kind of magic, this is incidental to his position and not essentially connected with it. Magical knowledge is just as often the property of commoners. Sobak, one of the rain-makers of Kurtatchi, is a commoner.

Blackwood describes three political offices at the level of the 'village or group of hamlets': 'tsunaun', head of the dominant lineage, 'kukerai', village head appointed by the colonial administration, and 'tultul', assistant to the kukerai. The office of tsunaun was clearly indigenous, but the office of kukerai had recently been imposed by the German administration. Ideally tsunaun were appointed as kukerai, but this was not always the case. There is no indication of indigenous supralocal authority operating at the time of fieldwork, but this may have existed in the past:

“In each village or group of hamlets there is one lineage group which takes precedence of all the others. This lineage may belong to any clan, and the clan to which it belongs is considered the most important, and is generally the most numerous, in that village. It may be that this group originally formed the nucleus round which the village has grown. The head of such a lineage is called tsunaun.” (Blackwood, 1935, p. 45)

""Some tsunaun possessed, in the olden days, authority much wider than that over their own kindred or village. This extended authority seems to be bound up with the state of sporadic warfare that existed all the time, not only between the coast people and those of the interior, but also among the coast villages themselves. [48] Certain groups joined together against a common enemy, and asked one tsunaun to lead them all. Something of this extended authority in a very attenuated condition, still survives. Pinari claimed a vague allegiance from the people of Timputs and Baniu, and said that before the time of the white man his lineage held sway over all the people living along the north coast of Bougainville and some of those of Buka. Pinari had a love of power and a somewhat exaggerated sense of his own importance, and detailed investigation in the area involved might have led to a modification of his statements, but there is no doubt that he had at one time been a tsunaun of considerable importance. He claimed that in the olden days his consent had to be asked before a fighting expedition was embarked upo... The tsunaun was supposed to go to fight with his own people and to keep them together and prevent them from fighting among themselves. If he gave orders which were not obeyed, some of his followers would kill the offenders ...Exactly what the powers of the tsunaun were in the olden days it is now very difficult, and perhaps impossible, to ascertain. The whole position has been fundamentally altered by the new system introduced by the Germans and continued by the present Government. An official, called the ‘kukerai’, is appointed for each village, or group of hamlets, who is responsible to the District Officer for the good behaviour of the villagers, but whose right to punish is limited to the imposition of a fine and, if that is ineffective, making a report to the D.O ... He has under him a subordinate officer, called the ‘tultul’, who is usually chosen because of his ability to speak pidgin-English, so that he can act as interpreter between the natives and the government officials. In appointing the kukerai, inquiries are made of the natives as to the persons they consider of importance, and if possible some one who is tsunaun is chosen, when his position as a government official is materially strengthened by the fact that his authority is already recognized in the village. But in some instances the tsunaun is either unwilling to take office under the white man, or is [49] considered by the D.O. to be unsuitable by reason of his age, degree of intelligence, or on other grounds. Some other man is then chosen at the discretion of the D.O., and though the natives are obliged to acknowledge him, he continues to rank, in their estimation, as a commoner, and his position is not an easy one, unless he is friendly with the hereditary head of the group ... In case of actual hostility between the hereditary tsunaun and the government-appointed kukerai, the position of the latter, though unassailable, would be far from enviable. The possibility was admitted and discussed, but no instances of it came under my personal observation … As a result of this substitution of the government-controlled jurisdiction of the kukerai for the traditional jurisdiction of the tsunaun, and with the passing of warfare, in which the powers and rights of the tsunaun were most clearly apparent, the original state of affairs has become so difficult to disentangle that I am not able to give a clear account of the exact position occupied by the tsunaun of the olden days. It is certain that he possessed the power of life and death over those under his jurisdiction, but I have no very clear evidence as to whether he exercised it entirely alone, or how much he conferred, in this and other matters of importance, [50] with other tsunaun or with the old men of the group. A good deal seems always to have depended on personal character. Although the fact of being tsunaun was determined by heredity, and was inalienable, certain people are remembered, while others are forgotten, and it is natural that the man of strong personality would exercise authority far exceeding that of a tsunaun who was weak or indolent.
It seems likely that the elective and purely local office of kukerai will, in course of time, entirely supersede the hereditary tsunaun, who is primarily, though not exclusively, entitled to allegiance from his own clan."" (Blackwood, 1935, pp. 47-50)",blackwood-1935[45-53]

17705,bukidnon,85,2,151-2,"Bukidnon villages had headmen (called dato) who administered justice. Datos also existed at the level of the ‘district’ or ‘region’, though these ‘head datos’ do not appear to have had much control over the local leaders (the only function they are described as having is judging cases that local datos could not settle). The role of dato was to some extent religious - they were protected by spirits who ‘aided them in their duties’, and the village datos, at least, are described as having been 'important functionaries in the ceremonies':

""The datos claimed the special protection of a group of spirits – Omalágad, Pamahándi, Tomanod, Molin-olin and Ibabasó – who aided them in their duties. The datos were important functionaries in in the ceremonies and were judges in all matters of dispute. If the case was a difficult one, the dato called in the headmen of the region and discussed it with them, and it is said that at times the dispute might go to the head dato. The procedure in a case is described as follows. The evidence was heard and a penalty assessed. Then the culprit and the accuser were directed to take hold of the ends of a piece of rattan, while the dato besought the spirits to watch. Next he directed the accused person to cut through the rattan with a single blow of his bolo (knife). If he failed it was a sign that he still had an evil mind and was unrepentant and deserving of additional punishment. If he succeeded the accuser was directed to cut the rattan. Failure on his part indicated that he was not satisfied with the judgement and ultimately would avenge himself.

""When the datos were assured that justice had been done, they directed the two parties to exchange head-cloths as a sign that they agreed with the verdict. This done, the dato took the rattan and holding it in his hands addressed the Magbabaya, gimokod and other spirits, asking them to take notice that the parties had accepted the judgement and invoking their aid in punishing whichever one might break his promises."" (Cole, 1956, pp 79-80)

However, ‘most’ religious ritual was performed by the baylans. According to Cole the baylans ‘do not form a priesthood’, although it is not entirely clear what this means. They are described as ‘officiating’ at ‘major events when the spirits are summoned’:

""Most traffic with the spirit world is through or with the aid of the baylans - a group of men or women who claim the ability to discover the cause of sickness. They also know how to conduct ceremonies acceptable to the spirits ... The baylans do not form a priesthood, although they are a definite group. Should one of them be visiting in a village where a ceremony is in progress he or she assists as a matter of course."" (Cole, 1956, p 89)

“The baylans must conduct the Kaliga-ōn ceremony and they usually officiate at all major events where the spirits are summoned. (However, minor offerings may be made by anyone ‘who knows how to talk to the spirits’).” (Cole, 1956, p 90)

There were multiple baylans in a settlement (Cole, 1956, p 91) but one may have been supreme – there is mention of the ‘ranking baylan’ of one settlement (p 93).

Of the ceremonies described by Cole (1956, pp 99-117), all but one appear to have been performed for individuals or for families. Only one (the pagampo) appears to have been observed at the village level, and this is the only description of a ceremony in which the dato is mentioned at all (all the ceremonies described involve baylans):

""PANGAMPO ... This is a community affair when an epidemic, such as smallpox, threatens; or when locusts invade the area or other disasters seem imminent. The headman (dato or presidente) summons all the people to a general meeting. The danger is stated and a day is set when all will assemble, each bearing gifts for the spirits whose help is sought ... All the people of the village gather around while the baylans call first to the gimokod of the dead, then to the Mabgabaya and the Alabyanon and especially to Bulalakau, god of the water."" (Cole, 1956, p 99)

The relationship between the dato and the baylans is not quite clear, but since the 'head dato' appears to have had nominal authority over all the Bukidnon living in his territory, he presumably had authority over them also.

Hence religious practitioners were not a special social category, and potentially any person could serve in any ritual role. Traditional ceremonies can be classified into two categories: life-cycle rituals and calendrical rituals. Generally speaking, the former continue to be practiced with an overlay of Christian features … [71] … By contrast, the traditional calendrical rituals have been abandoned with the demise of shifting cultivation … Whatever the type of ritual, the Bunun usually held them privately and did not go through complex processes. Even the major traditional agricultural ritual, the Mapulaho, was initiated by public shaman (Lisigadan lus-an) in his field without the presence of other members. After his performance, each domestic unit would choose a member to perform it privately.” (Huang, 1995, pp. 70-71)

“The political organization of the traditional Bunun is relatively simple … There were two political offices: the Lisigadan lus-an and the Lavian (Huang 1982: 332-4). The former was in charge of social order within the settlement. The Lisigidan lusan was a shaman whose duty was to direct all agricultural rituals … [75] … In addition, as a leader, he had to have the ability to mediate between quarrelling parties and resolve differences in the settlement.

“The lavian was a political leader who dealt with relations with other settlements or other tribes. He had to be the bravest and most skilful warrior in leading his people to defend their settlement from invasions by outsiders.” (Huang, 1993, pp. 74-75)","huang1995[70-71, 74-75]"

19267,ontong-java,86,3,150-3,"The people of Ontong Java were divided into two 'tribes', each of which occupied multiple 'viillages':

“Formerly there were dwellings on practically all the islands, and large villages on Luangiua, Pelau, Keila, Kiloma, Kepae, Kemalu, and ‘Avaha. The only two villages of any size to-day are on Luangiua and Pelau.

“The people are divided into two tribes. The members of one tribe, the less important both socially and numerically, own the part of the atoll near the island of Pelau, while the members of the other own all the remaining islands. Each tribe has its main village, one situated on Pelau island and [94] one on Luangiua. They have no distinguishing native names, but it will be convenient to call each after its own island.

“Each tribe is made up of a number of joint families, groups of individuals who are closely related. The joint family forms a compact unit, for it is practically autonomous, and the members own land and property jointly. Other economic units are the canoe-owning group, the house-owning group, the gardening group and the household. The tribe as a whole combines only to carry out religious ceremonies, the most important of which centre around the sanga rites, performed for one month of every year. Each tribe has a temple in its main village, and here ceremonies were formerly carried out daily by the priests.” (Hogbin, 1939, pp. 93-94)

‘The legal system’ (Hogbin, 1934, pp. 210-231)

‘The earlier judicial system’ (Hogbin, 1934, pp. 210-211)

Prior to the establishment of the 'kingship', the only tribal-level functionaries besides the maakua (priests) were the polepole, a group headed by a figure called the koko'a whose role was to guard public property against theft:
 
“If crime is defined as a specific act which is punished by society, either collectively or through its officers, we may say that in those days there was only one crime. This was the theft of coconuts from the common property or of taro from the swamps situated thereon.

“The malae was limited on the north by a broad path running right across the island from shore to shore. At either end stood a building, the hale-'api. These were the houses of the polepole,' officers whose duty it was to prevent trespass on the common land and to carry out punishment on any person they discovered doing so. These polepole were appointed by the maakua and, in later days, by the king. There were about fifty of them, and they took it in [211] turns to keep a lookout. The koko'a (literally, door), almost always a member of the joint family of one or other of the major maakua, acted as their head.

“When a person was found on the common land without good excuse he was brought before the koko'a. Criminals were punished for a first offence by having their heads shaved, but a second offence led to something more serious, either exposure naked in the sun without food or water for some time, or more frequently, death … Unfortunately not possible to give details of the judicial procedure because there are to-day no polepole. It is, nevertheless, quite certain that theft from the common property did almost inevitably lead to punishment if it was discovered.” (Hogbin, 1934, pp 210-211)

Around 1800 a 'kingship' was established in both of the tribes:

“Some eight generations ago, so the tradition runs, a man named Ke hangamea organized a body of supporters into a sort of army. With the assistance of these men he set himself up as head of the Luangiua tribe and compelled all to obey him … This led to a good deal of unrest, and he was eventually murdered. Despite the end of his career, his example fired other men, and for a number of years a series of battles took place between claimants for the position. After perhaps three generations it was secured by ‘Avi’o, and descendants of his have held it ever since … The holder of the position of the head of the tribe will be spoken of as the king .His native title is heku'u, a word without any other meaning that I could discover … As time went on the kings acquired more and more power. The most powerful of them began to reign about 1878, a few years after the massacre of the crew of the first European ship to enter the lagoon. This was King Uila. He died in 1905 and was followed by Ke aepea, who lived till 1915. (Hogbin, 1934, p 224)

""The Pelau tribe has followed the Luangiua tribe in practically every detail. A kingdom was established in Pelau village at much the same time that ‘Avi’o established himself at Luangiua. In course of time the kings modified the rights of private vengeance, and the present king, Pongavalo, is the president of a court which closely resembles that of Mekaike."" (Hogbin, 1934, p 231)

‘Cases of judicial action by the king’ (Hogbin, 1934, pp. 225-229)

The role of the king appears to have been primarily that of arbitration:

“As the king became more and more powerful a change came about: the idea of the king's peace was created. In the times of the early kings the change did not progress very far. Perhaps the only noticeable difference then was the additional security which the relatives of the king enjoyed. Nevertheless, there are several recorded instances of these kings banishing relatives and cutting them off from the privileges of the joint family, because they had wantonly abused the position which their relationship gave them by committing such acts as rape and murder.

“In the reign of Ke ulaho, the predecessor of Uila, the change had progressed so far that we hear of persons laying complaints against offenders before him and asking for his help to secure compensation or revenge. The important groups still kept matters in their own hands and settled their quarrels without assistance, but Ke ulaho on two or three occasions seems to have arranged matters so that a wronged husband had the right of retaliation on his wife's lover without any fear of a counter attack from his relatives. This king also kept his own relatives in check so that they did not take advantage of their relationship.” (Hogbin, 1934, p. 225)","hogbin1934[93-94, 210-231]"

17716,Varisi,84,2,149-2,"Description of Choiseulese religion: Scheffler (1965, pp 240-253). Scheffler describes two figures as having religious roles within a given sinangge (descent group) – the batu (‘manager’ of a descent group) and the ‘keeper of the bangara’. The religious role of the batu was as a mediator between a group and its ancestral spirits (manuru), particularly those of his deceased predecessors: 

""Any man having ancestors residing at a particular shrine could go there and make small offerings of food and prayers to the manuru [ancestral spirits] of that place … The deceased batu [managers] were by far the most important ancestors, and the person with the most immediate and continuing interest in them was the living batu. He derived much of his power in the form of mana from them, and the more powerful they were in life the more mana they could confer as ancestors. They favoured their own descendants, especially lineal ones, but they would confer mana upon ‘anyone who was good for the group’ too … The recognition of the living manager, especially if he were a batu ununa pua [‘true batu’, i.e. one with genealogical qualifications] rather than a batu sokele [one without genealogical qualifications], was sustained by the presentation of first-fruits, and this presentation was sanctioned by his relation to the ancestors of the land. These had to be presented to the manager or the ancestral ghosts of the group would not sustain the productivity of the land. Upon receipt of the first-fruits the manager made an offering to the ancestors and asked them to ‘bless’ the garden concerned.""(Scheffler, 1965, pp 250-251)

Bangara were beings who were not ancestors and were not believed to have been human. The role of ‘keeper of the bangara’ carried no secular power in itself, but was often occupied by the batu:

""Ideally, each descent group maintained at least one bangara, and some maintained several, each belonging to a branch even though this branch might not have been separate in other ways. Each branch in the latter instance 'fed' or gave sacrifices to its own bangara. But not just anyone could do this; feeding the bangara was the responsibility of only one man who 'cared' for it, and that man was not necessarily the batu. As bangara proved themselves more or less powerful, they were said to care for the whole descent group, and requests could be made by other branches for the keeper to ask the bangara for assistance … Each bangara had a ‘sacred place’ and usually some representation of the bangara was kept there. The place itself was in the bush away from settlements and paths, and was strictly out of bounds to all but the keeper of the bangara … [245] … It was the duty of the keeper to feed the bangara regularly and also to make it offerings of ziku (shell rings) or miniature imitations of them. At the same time he asked the bangara to give his group good fortune in the form of health, wealth, and success in all endeavours, enumerating them at length … [246] … None of my information indicates that the keeper of the bangara played more than a sacred or religious role. The keeper merely acted as the group's representative vis-a-vis the dangerous person of the bangara, and this role conferred upon him a degree of respect but no further formal powers. Anyone who could speak to bangara and manuru could occupy such a position, and though the keeper's son was the most eligible successor he could be succeeded by any member of the group. Managers sometimes 'kept' bangara, and some managers were thought to derive much power from particular ones, but a manager could be strong even without a bangara."" (Scheffler, 1965, pp. 244-246)

Bangara and manuru appear to have been of similar importance in Choiseulese religion, though the former were believed to be stronger:

""Mana was given by the gods (bangara) and spirits or ghosts of the dead (manuru) to those persons who regularly observed all restricts and customs and who fed the gods and ghosts at the proper times … [243] … Bangara were more powerful, ‘stronger’, than the manuru. They were also considerably less numerous and of greater strategic significance in intergroup relationships. One indication of their greater strength, and an acknowledgement of it, was that they received the first offerings of the smoked nuts ready for storage at the end of the nutting season. Offerings were made at all shrines at that time, but the bangara got the first and largest share."" (Scheffer, 1965, p 242)

Bangara and manuru cults do not appear to have gone beyond the local level:

The establishment of separate bangara and ancestor shrines probably followed the establishment of separate residence and these were stages in the development of separate political identity. (Scheffler, 1965, p 252)

The ‘keeper of the bangara’ appears to have been an office in that it was a clearly defined position (one for every descent group or descent group branch) with clear rights and duties (‘feeding the bangara’). The position of batu does not quite meet the definition of an office (‘a standardised set of duties and privileges devolving upon a person in a certain situation’, Hughes, 1937). In theory, authority was vested in the batu unuma pua, whose status was ascribed, but often it was exercised by the batu sokele, who had achieved his status. The former had a right to ‘deferential treatment’ but not to leadership (though he did have a competitive advantage should he wish to compete for leadership). It is not clear that he had any duties. 

""Each descent group is said to have a batu, big-man or manager, who is its principal leader. According to the dogmas, managerial status ‘crosses’ from father to elder son. However, a group may contain several men who are spoken of as batu and still others, adult, able-bodied men, with families, who are called kazigarata. All these men, regardless of their descent statuses have a right to a voice in group affairs, yet some are entitled to a ‘stronger’ voice than others …[180] ... The man who meets the genealogical qualifications of primogeniture and agnatic status is known as the 'true batu' or the batu 'who originates in the land' (batu ununua pua). Others are batu sokele, with the implication that they are ‘almost but not quite’ true batu. Thus batu implies not only formal qualifications but also behavioural attributes … A batu in the fullest sense, then, is one who meets both genealogical and practical qualifications.""(Scheffler, 1965, pp. 179-180)

""Prestige was accorded to men and groups who were successful in the most important intergroup activities, such as vengeance warfare and gift exchange … Each manager had to demonstrate his own worth before and while ‘in office.’ If he did not he would find himself gradually superseded by another who had earned the favour of descent-group members. The Choiseulese say that in effect the ‘people’ sometimes chose their manager by ‘discussion’ (vatovato), a term which is also applied to the more or less formal discussion of particular issues among descent group members. To make someone a batu was to va batua, but there were no formal ceremonies of installation. Therefore, recognition as a manager, and even as the manager, came about gradually and informally; it was the product of a gradually developed understanding within the descent group. It is said that the people would discuss the matter informally, come to a consensus, and then eventually appoint one of their number to communicate to the chosen party their wish for him to be their manager, but consensus sometimes probably came after the assumption of political predominance within the group.

""[183] Becoming a manager was essentially a process of acquiring wealth and a reliable following … A man who did this without meeting the formal genealogical qualifications was known as a batu sokele, but as long as there was no serious contender with better formal qualifications as well as the pragmatic ones, a batu sokele could operate as though he were the manager in the fullest sense. There are cases even today in which a man who is a nonagnate is generally recognized as a manager even though there are men more fully qualified in the formal sense.

‘Itang and the Rites of Political Power’ (Goodenough, 2002, pp. 290-320)

Many religious specialists are described, but the most important were clearly the itang ('political priests'). Indeed, Goodenough describes the itang as 'the most prestigious and awesome members of Chuukese society'. Itang clearly for the most part operated at the district level:

""IN THE RITUALS OF war, we encountered a major role of the political priests, the itang, on Chuukese religious life. Their importance as the most prestigious and awesome members of Chuukese society went well beyond warfare. Their knowledge gave legitimacy to chiefs and provided a system of sanctions upholding the political and social order. They were the orators at assemblies, where they expounded on public morals, preaching on the proper way for people to behave to one another and to their chiefs. They were the principal players in the competitive politics through which chiefs sought to gain renown. THey competed with one another to enhance their own reputations as men who had rhetorical skill, historical knowledge, and access to the most efficacious and formidable spirit power (manaman) ... Efot (1947) described the range of subject matter comprising itang lore as 1. medicines (sáfeey, 2. A special cryptic way of talking (kkapasen itang) and rhetorical arts generally, 3. Lore of the land (kkapasen fénú), including local history (wuruwo), and 4. Lore relating to the creation or beginning of the world (also wurowuro) … [291] … The medicines that itang dealt with were those relating to war (sáfeen móówun), those relating to the safeguarding of the land (sáfeen fénú), and medicines of people (safeen aramas), including various roong (spells and medicines) known to healers and particularly the medicines to cure illness that itang could inflict on others through their knowledge of sorcery and cursing spells … The special way of talking including the use of archaic words and constructions … [292] … Lore of the land (wuruwoon fénú) included the history of the founding of a district and the critical events thereafter leading to the current political situation: the succession of chiefs and their actions. Such lore also included the history of land ownership and transactions, on which the founding of a districts constituent lineages and their political rights depended … Contrasting with the lore of the land (wuruwoon fénú) was lore of people (wuruwoon aramas). The latter consisted of knowledge of genealogies and of the traditions of clans and lineages.” (Goodenough, 2002, pp. 290-292)

Each district appears to have had a ‘senior itang’:

""Aside from the chief, a district’s military leader was the senior itang (political priest) who in many respects outranked the district chief."" (Goodenough, 2002, p 277)

However, there were also itang 'schools' or 'leagues' that incorporated many districts:

""By the beginning of the nineteenth century, there were two major rival political leagues, each with its own tradition and, within it, regional schools of itang lore, the Máchewen Sópwunupi and the Mácheweyi-Chchún. The former was associated with Wééné … Island and the latter with Feefen … Island. Most of Chuuk’s islands and districts were affiliates of one or the other of these two leagues. Politically independent of the two major leagues was the Máchewen Wúnaap, associated with Wuumaan … Island. But the Wúnaap school of itang was also present in several subtraditions in Wútéét and other parts of Chuuk … A tradition of itang lore was also associated with Chuuk’s neighbouring atolls and with the districts making up the northern tier of Wééné (Efengin Wééné) but I have no information about it.” (Goodenough, 2002, p. 301)

Districts within a league were ranked, so presumably the senior itang of the highest-ranked district was considered the senior itang of the league:

""Quite apart from conquests of this kind were major interdistrict leagues, under the leadership of the most powerful chiefs and districts. In the nineteenth century, all of Chuuk, except for Wuumaan and the northern districts of Wééné, was divided into two great leagues that were pitted against each other in political and military rivalry. The leagues went by the names of the body of war rituals controlled by the particular schools of political priests (itang) that were headquartered on Wééné (Moen) and Feefen Islands. The league based on Wééné was called Máchewen Sópwunupi ... An old district on Wééné named Iras ... was by tradition the highest ranking district in the league ... The league based on Feefen and its school of itang were called Mácheweyi-Chchún ... Fóóngen on Feefen was the highest ranking district in that league. These leagues were chronically at war."" (Goodenough, 2002, p. 38)

The only communal activity engaged in by the leagues appears to have been war. Itang ('political priests') performed war magic and were considered ideal war leaders, though chiefs could also serve in this role. Both chiefs and high-ranking itang belonged to 'chiefly lineages', so the authority to lead in war could be seen as vested in chiefly lineages, and authority to perform war magic on behalf of a league specifically in the office of itang. 

""Chiefs might serve as war leaders, but it was preferable for an itang (political priest) to be leader (Krämer 1932:266; Efot 1947). If a chief led, his followers were more liable to be killed than if an itang led, because the latter knew the more powerful rituals and spells for protecting combatants from injury. Itang renowned for their achievements as war leaders were sought as allies."" (Goodenough, 2002, p 275)

""Aside from the chief, a district’s military leader was the senior itang (political priest) who in many respects outranked the district chief. It was the itang who performed the principal rites to ensure military success. It was he who decided, through divination, on the manner of attack. He indicated who would go in what canoe on a military expedition. Anyone violating his orders was liable to die in the ensuing battle."" (Goodenough, 2002, p 277)

""Chuuk’s itang were not formally organized as a professional group. Those who were knowledgeable taught their sons and their sister's sons, occasionally also their sister's husbands and their daughters to hold in trust for their children. Itang did not meet with other itang outside their kinship circle to exchange secrets and share what they knew. (Eiue 1947).

""Interdistrict dealings between chiefs and itang, however, required shared knowledge of a secret message system. A basket (chúúk) would be sent to the chief or itang in a neighbouring district. In it tobacco leaves were placed on top of an object of value ... The type of object conveyed the message, such as ‘there is war, come to help us.’ The chief or itang receiving the basket would open up what appeared to be a gift of tobacco and then announce some news to the mystification of the uninitiated (Kekin 1947)."" (Goodenough, 2002, p 302)

“Knowledge of itang was confined to members of chiefly lineages and to the children and descendants of chiefs. Ideally, chiefs themselves were expected to have such knowledge, but often there were other members of their lineage who were more proficient in it. More importantly, chiefly lineages of the Sópwunupi clan or of its clan offshoots were considered those most entitled to the knowledge and to be more knowledgeable, and hence more powerful in the use of that knowledge, than others who might also claim to know itang.

“Those with such knowledge who were in the direct line of transmission – members of the founding clan or in the direct line of descent through males from that clan – were chóóyiro (‘people of the arc’) … Mwáániireeto ‘men of near persons’) were eldest among a set of lineage brothers knowing itang. The younger brothers, mwáániireenó (‘men of far persons’) had to defer to their eldest brothers, or the eldest among them who was present, and not display their knowledge in speeches at public meetings without proper indications of deference … Among chóóyiro, there were recognized grades of knowledge (Efot 1947). At the highest level was the itangúpwpwún (‘dirt itang’), presumably so called because of his power to make an ordinary person ill when chewing red earth by simply addressing words directly at him. It took about two years of schooling to achieve the highest level of knowledge required to be an itangúpwpwún … [305] … Those who had acquired knowledge of itang but who were not in the direct line of descent (who were not chóóyiro) were aché or achéémaaraw (‘payment makers’ or ‘unripe payment makers’). They might include a sister’s husband of an itang, married into the chiefly lineage, who had been taught the lore so he could pass it on to his children in that lineage, or to an itang’s wife’s brother, who would teach it to his sister’s sons, the itang’s children. Some women in the line of descent were also taught itang lore. They could not practice as itang, but they could hold the knowledge in trust for their children.

“More numerous among the ache were the purchasers (as the term implies) of itang knowledge and their descendants. For an itang to reveal the special meanings of itang talk to someone not eligible by descent to learn it would result in his own or his sister’s son’s death, unless appropriate payment was made … Lineages of clans that were not in the direct line of descent often gained a district chiefship through war or through succession as ‘children’ of a chiefly line that had died out. To validate their chiefly position it was essential for them to acquire knowledge of itang … Lineages needing to acquire such knowledge did so by paying a sizeable tuition to an itang to teach them. An aché was [306] not entitled to make a public display of his knowledge in the presence of a chóóyiro. It was also understood that aché did not ordinarily have the same depth of knowledge as the highest grade of chóóyiro. (Boutau 1965).

“The two great political leagues under the aegis of the itang schools of Máchewen Sópwunupi and Mácheweyi-Chchún were thus comprised of [sic] districts with chiefly lineages in the senior line of descent (the highest ranking) and chiefly lineages in the senior line of descent (the highest ranking) and chiefly lineages in junior lines of descent – all of them chóóyiro, ‘people of the arc [of heaven]’ – together with districts whose chiefly lineages had knowledge of their school of itang as aché (purchasers).” (Goodenough, 2002, pp. 304-306)

Another comment on the importance of the itang vis-a-vis other religious specialists:

""The breadth of their knowledge, the centrality of their role in political and social life, and the power of their spells and curses made them the most feared and prestigious among the different kinds of religious specialists in Chuuk."" (Goodenough, 2002, p. 315)

Other religious specialists who served groups of people were the 'medium' and the 'breadfruit summoner', and probably also the 'fish summoner':

'Mediums' could operate at the 'lineage', 'district', or 'community' level:

""People valued having a medium within their own lineage or kindred so they could have ready access to the spirit world, especially in case of illness. Every community had its own 'effecting spirit' (or spirits), each with its own distinctive spirit name ... Kubary (as quoted by Krämer 1932:318) reported from the 1880s that mediums were usually close to chiefs by birth and that there were usually two mediums, one male and one female, in each clan. Presumably he was referring to whatever was the chiefly lineage in a district."" (Goodenough, 2002, p. 158)

The 'breadfruit summoner' performed on behalf of the 'community' or 'district':

""The breadfruit summoner had to perform the summoning rites each year to ensure a good harvest, because the very existence of breadfruit in Chuuk was a result of this ritual. He performed it on behalf of the community by request of the chief. Without such a request, he performed the rites privately on his and his kin's behalf. (Efot 1947)."" (Goodenough, 2002, p. 193)

""During the course of these events, the men of the summoner's community or district had set to work making toy sailing canoes (nuunu) of their own or had arranged to have them made for them."" (Goodenough, 2002, p. 196)

The same appears to have been true of the 'fish summoner', though this is not stated explicitly:

“A ‘fish summoner’ (sowuyótoowik, ‘master of making fish come’) was often also a breadfruit summoner; but the two offices were district, each with its own title and not necessarily combined in the same person … [204] … It is clear that the ritual for summoning fish was generally similar to that for summoning breadfruit, but was not as elaborate.” (Goodenough, 2002, pp. 203-204) 

Other religious specialists (e.g. diviners, craftsmen who used magic, appear to have served only individual clients.",goodenough2002[156-320]

‘Itang and the Rites of Political Power’ (Goodenough, 2002, pp. 290-320)

The Chuukese lived in ‘communities’ that were often, but not always, coterminous with ‘districts’. Some communities consisted of multiple districts. It is not clear that districts ever included multiple communities:

""Settlements were not densely clustered. Rather, a local community consisted of a number of extended family households scattered in isolation or in small clusters over suitable lands to which the households had access. The resulting hamlets were connected by footpaths; and a main path tended to go around, or part way around, an island parallel to and a little way back from the shore, where the higher ground begins, linking its several communities together."" (Goodenough, 2002, p. 23)

""Local residential communities of people sharing their lives as neighbours often were contained within the boundaries of a single district. Here and there, however, and from time to time, a community might involve two or more [43] districts together. By marrying back and forth, the members of the various lineages came to have holdings in the several districts. The chief of one could owe first fruits to the chief of another and vice versa ... In such a situation, the several households in the community might be distributed over lands in the several neighbouring districts or they might be concentrated on lands within one of them ... In any case, a community, whether it was coterminous with a district or included more than one, was a group of lineages that married back and forth among one another and that were held together, therefore, by a network of overlapping kinship ties."" (Goodenough, 2002, pp 42-43)

Many religious specialists are described, but the most important were clearly the itang ('political priests'). Indeed, Goodenough describes the itang as 'the most prestigious and awesome members of Chuukese society'. Itang clearly for the most part operated at the district level:

""IN THE RITUALS OF war, we encountered a major role of the political priests, the itang, on Chuukese religious life.

Each district appears to have had a ‘senior itang’:

""Aside from the chief, a district’s military leader was the senior itang (political priest) who in many respects outranked the district chief."" (Goodenough, 2002, p 277)

However, there were also itang 'schools' or 'leagues' that incorporated many districts:

""By the beginning of the nineteenth century, there were two major rival political leagues, each with its own tradition and, within it, regional schools of itang lore, the Máchewen Sópwunupi and the Mácheweyi-Chchún.

The only communal activity engaged in by the leagues appears to have been war. Itang ('political priests') were considered ideal war leaders, though chiefs could also serve in this role. Both chiefs and high-ranking itang belonged to 'chiefly lineages', so leadership of the leagues could be seen as vested in lineages rather than individuals.

""Chiefs might serve as war leaders, but it was preferable for an itang (political priest) to be leader (Krämer 1932:266; Efot 1947). If a chief led, his followers were more liable to be killed than if an itang led, because the latter knew the more powerful rituals and spells for protecting combatants from injury. Itang renowned for their achievements as war leaders were sought as allies."" (Goodenough, 2002, p 275)

""Aside from the chief, a district’s military leader was the senior itang (political priest) who in many respects outranked the district chief. It was the itang who performed the principal rites to ensure military success. It was he who decided, through divination, on the manner of attack. He indicated who would go in what canoe on a military expedition. Anyone violating his orders was liable to die in the ensuing battle."" (Goodenough, 2002, p 277)

""Chuuk’s itang were not formally organized as a professional group. Those who were knowledgeable taught their sons and their sister's sons, occasionally also their sister's husbands and their daughters to hold in trust for their children. Itang did not meet with other itang outside their kinship circle to exchange secrets and share what they knew. (Eiue 1947).

""Interdistrict dealings between chiefs and itang, however, required shared knowledge of a secret message system. A basket (chúúk) would be sent to the chief or itang in a neighbouring district. In it tobacco leaves were placed on top of an object of value ... The type of object conveyed the message, such as ‘there is war, come to help us.’ The chief or itang receiving the basket would open up what appeared to be a gift of tobacco and then announce some news to the mystification of the uninitiated (Kekin 1947)."" (Goodenough, 2002, p 302)

“Knowledge of itang was confined to members of chiefly lineages and to the children and descendants of chiefs. Ideally, chiefs themselves were expected to have such knowledge, but often there were other members of their lineage who were more proficient in it. More importantly, chiefly lineages of the Sópwunupi clan or of its clan offshoots were considered those most entitled to the knowledge and to be more knowledgeable, and hence more powerful in the use of that knowledge, than others who might also claim to know itang.

“Those with such knowledge who were in the direct line of transmission – members of the founding clan or in the direct line of descent through males from that clan – were chóóyiro (‘people of the arc’) … Mwáániireeto ‘men of near persons’) were eldest among a set of lineage brothers knowing itang. The younger brothers, mwáániireenó (‘men of far persons’) had to defer to their eldest brothers, or the eldest among them who was present, and not display their knowledge in speeches at public meetings without proper indications of deference … Among chóóyiro, there were recognized grades of knowledge (Efot 1947). At the highest level was the itangúpwpwún (‘dirt itang’), presumably so called because of his power to make an ordinary person ill when chewing red earth by simply addressing words directly at him. It took about two years of schooling to achieve the highest level of knowledge required to be an itangúpwpwún … [305] … Those who had acquired knowledge of itang but who were not in the direct line of descent (who were not chóóyiro) were aché or achéémaaraw (‘payment makers’ or ‘unripe payment makers’). They might include a sister’s husband of an itang, married into the chiefly lineage, who had been taught the lore so he could pass it on to his children in that lineage, or to an itang’s wife’s brother, who would teach it to his sister’s sons, the itang’s children. Some women in the line of descent were also taught itang lore. They could not practice as itang, but they could hold the knowledge in trust for their children.

“More numerous among the ache were the purchasers (as the term implies) of itang knowledge and their descendants. For an itang to reveal the special meanings of itang talk to someone not eligible by descent to learn it would result in his own or his sister’s son’s death, unless appropriate payment was made … Lineages of clans that were not in the direct line of descent often gained a district chiefship through war or through succession as ‘children’ of a chiefly line that had died out. To validate their chiefly position it was essential for them to acquire knowledge of itang … Lineages needing to acquire such knowledge did so by paying a sizeable tuition to an itang to teach them. An aché was [306] not entitled to make a public display of his knowledge in the presence of a chóóyiro. It was also understood that aché did not ordinarily have the same depth of knowledge as the highest grade of chóóyiro. (Boutau 1965).

“The two great political leagues under the aegis of the itang schools of Máchewen Sópwunupi and Mácheweyi-Chchún were thus comprised of [sic] districts with chiefly lineages in the senior line of descent (the highest ranking) and chiefly lineages in the senior line of descent (the highest ranking) and chiefly lineages in junior lines of descent – all of them chóóyiro, ‘people of the arc [of heaven]’ – together with districts whose chiefly lineages had knowledge of their school of itang as aché (purchasers).” (Goodenough, 2002, pp. 304-306)

Another comment on the importance of the itang vis-a-vis other religious specialists:

""The breadth of their knowledge, the centrality of their role in political and social life, and the power of their spells and curses made them the most feared and prestigious among the different kinds of religious specialists in Chuuk."" (Goodenough, 2002, p. 315)

Other religious specialists who served groups of people were the 'medium' and the 'breadfruit summoner', and probably also the 'fish summoner':

'Mediums' could operate at the 'lineage', 'district', or 'community' level:

""People valued having a medium within their own lineage or kindred so they could have ready access to the spirit world, especially in case of illness. Every community had its own 'effecting spirit' (or spirits), each with its own distinctive spirit name ... Kubary (as quoted by Krämer 1932:318) reported from the 1880s that mediums were usually close to chiefs by birth and that there were usually two mediums, one male and one female, in each clan. Presumably he was referring to whatever was the chiefly lineage in a district."" (Goodenough, 2002, p. 158)

The 'breadfruit summoner' performed on behalf of the 'community' or 'district':

""The breadfruit summoner had to perform the summoning rites each year to ensure a good harvest, because the very existence of breadfruit in Chuuk was a result of this ritual. He performed it on behalf of the community by request of the chief. Without such a request, he performed the rites privately on his and his kin's behalf. (Efot 1947)."" (Goodenough, 2002, p. 193)

""During the course of these events, the men of the summoner's community or district had set to work making toy sailing canoes (nuunu) of their own or had arranged to have them made for them."" (Goodenough, 2002, p. 196)

The same appears to have been true of the 'fish summoner', though this is not stated explicitly:

“A ‘fish summoner’ (sowuyótoowik, ‘master of making fish come’) was often also a breadfruit summoner; but the two offices were district, each with its own title and not necessarily combined in the same person … [204] … It is clear that the ritual for summoning fish was generally similar to that for summoning breadfruit, but was not as elaborate.” (Goodenough, 2002, pp. 203-204) 

Other religious specialists (e.g. diviners, craftsmen who used magic, appear to have served only individual clients.","goodenough2002[17-46, 156-320]"

Fortune (1932, pp. 94-102, 'Sketch of the concept of ritual')

The only religious specialists described by Bromilow are 'sorcerers' (or more accurately 'magicians'), who could practice malevolent or benevolent magic:

“But the really vital, working creed of primitive Dobuans is to be found in their belief, already referred to, in sorcery and witchcraft ... How complete is the power of the malign sorcerer will be seen from the following infallible items of Dobuan belief ... [91] ... It is true, there are the counter-charms of the beneficent sorcerer, but they are no sure and sufficient offset to the contrary powers of darkness. In order to make life at all bearable and to inspire some sense of relief and safety, the benevolent sorcerer is in constant demand to do his best to frustrate his malignant brother practitioner. On special occasions his presence is the first necessity – e.g. before going on a voyage the members of the crew have their bodies charmed, and the canoe has each of its parts and fittings placed under its own charm … and finally, the ocean itself is subjected to an incantation. So when a garden is being prepared, the tools must be charmed, and the proper spell be employed before burning off the [92] overgrowth, before planting, during the growth of the crop, and when the harvest is being gathered. Thus it is right through life’s affairs, down to each detail.” (Bromilow, 1929, pp. 90-92)

Fortune (1932) agrees on the centrality of magic in Dobuan religion. Successful magic was believed to depend upon knowledge of incantations. This knowledge was the property of individuals and was jealously guarded, even against close relatives. It would seem to follow that no one had a socially recognised 'right' to perform magic on anyone's behalf.

""The ritual of Dobu consists essentially in the use of incantations in the performance of certain activities such as canoe making and fishing-net making, in agriculture, in soliciting presents of valuables in the annual exchanges made by the long overseas expeditions, in the creating of love, in the making of [96] wind and rain, in the causing and the curing of disease, and in the causing of death. These are the most striking fields in which incantation is used, but it ramifies still more widely. Incantations exist also to strengthen the memory, to inflict mosquito plagues upon others, to exorcise them from oneself, to make coconut and betel palms bear, to create pregnancy and to prevent unwelcome visitors from visiting again.

“These incantations are often supplemented by the obligatory use of certain leaves, roots, and fluids, and these auxiliaries are believed to have power in their own right, so that a man who does not known an incantation may boast of the power of the root or the leaf or the fluid which he knows only; but in most of these cases he is making the best of his ignorance. Were he able to obtain the incantation he would certainly go to great pains in acquiring and memorising it, and he would be prepared to pay for the knowledge fairly heavily as native wealth goes; for the incantations are the most private of private property. They are always mumbled in a sing-song undertone and are never heard by others gratituitously. A pair of men engaged in the learning take the utmost care to prevent eavesdropping, usually resorting to a remote part of the bush for the purpose. For the most part the incantations keep within the family, and different families possess different knowledge. In these days workboys in possession of their earnings for two years or so of indentured labour, sometimes sell an incantation to a friend who is not a close relative … but native wealth cannot buy the knowledge between non-related persons as a rule.

“Knowledge of incantation is never given freely, or is never phrased as being given freely. A parent always commands a child’s services, a mother’s brother always commands a sister’s child’s services, and gifts of ritual knowledge from elder to youth are looked upon as the reward for these services … If a younger brother has helped his father or his mother’s brother … If a younger brother has helped his father or his mother’s brother in gardening more than his elder brother, he will probably be given all the ritual knowledge of [97] his two guardians … One brother does not share such a legacy with another brother. The system is one of unameliorated competition, the fruits of success being most jealously guarded from theft by close secrecy. I had a great deal of difficulty myself in succeeding in gaining my own knowledge of ritual. I had to penetrate into what is a close family secret, into what is the reward of long toil and services even within the family, and into a secret possession which one brother will not share with another … In the native view, ritual is the truest native wealth, more valuable than house, canoe, or ornaments. It is the means of sustaining all important social goods. Its exclusive possession for a few persons brings them in a small income by its practice for others who do not own it themselves.” (Fortune, 1932, pp. 95-97)",bromilow1929[77-94];fortune1932[94-102]

Religious authority among the Eastern Toraja appears to have been quite diffuse. Downs describes five kinds of 'intermediaries'.

The shaman (tadu) appear to have been the most important (most of the section is devoted to them). They served private clients, and also officiated at most if not all public ceremonies:

‘Shamans’ (Downs, 1956, pp. 47-52)

“Among the Bare’e Toradja the role of shaman was open only to women or to men who posed as women. They were called tadu (tadunja, according to Adriani) or tadu mburake ... One became a shaman by serving an apprenticeship ... [48] ... Several factors would seem to have contributed to the high esteem in which the shamans were held by the rest of the Toradja. In the first place the fact that they lived and worked as other women and received little pay for their services - none of them lived from it alone - meant that they did not form a separate class ... The chief function of the shamans was to retrieve the tanoana of sick people from the supernatural beings who had taken them by sending their own tanoana out after them. In this they were aided by their guardian spirits among the wurake).” (Downs, 1956, pp. 47-48)

“The services of shamans were invoked on a great variety of occasions. Kruyt, indeed, believed that they could be summoned in all difficult situations, even though it might not be quite necessary (II, 161). They had regular roles at the funeral ceremonies, where they retrieved the tanoana of the living from the underworld and rescued the dead from the juices of their decomposing bodies at the first funeral, and conducted the ceremonies at the second funeral, by which the dead were conducted to their final destination. Their services were also necessary at certain stages in the growing of the rice, as at the polanggo feast preceding the planting of the rice, when a shaman fetched the soul of the rice. She also did so if the rice plants weren’t healthy, and was invited in time of drought to persuade the wurake to give rain. They performed the mampapotanoana ritual for every child, inaugurated new houses, performed rituals for head-hunters before they set out on raids, for people returned from trips and for those who had narrowly escaped a great danger, and they reconciled blood relatives who had disowned each other (II, 149ff.).” (Downs, 1956, p. 52)

'Sando' consisted of two categories. The topopagere was a healer who appears to have served individual clients, while the sando mpodjamaa was a kind of agricultural magician, whose clientele could be drawn from his own village or further afield:

""Aside from the shamans there were several other people in each village skilled in caring for the health of its inhabitants and their crops. They went by the general name of sando (II, 169, 189). The topopagere, or 'masseuses', were exclusively women. Their technique consisted in chewing a certain root or other vegetable substance and spitting it on the painful part of the patient’s body, rubbing over the spot with a sirih pouch filled with various herbs, the paw of a marsupial, eagle claws, cat claws and the teeth of a crocodile, and finally squeezing out through the skin the object which had supposedly caused the pain ... [53] ... In addition to the sando who treated the sick there were sando mpodjamaa, mostly men, who were concerned with ensuring the success of the crops (III, 23f.). Each of these sando had connections with a particular spirit, with whom he conversed at night in the presence of the villagers and who gave him various things, such as rice, herbs and ritual formulas, to promote the growth of the crops ... 	
The sando mpodjamaa did not concern himself with the ordinary course of events in the fields (except where his own fields were concerned), but was called in under unusual circumstances, particularly if the prospects for the harvest were bad. At this time he apparently did not limit himself to seeking the aid of his spiritual helper, but performed all kinds of rituals designed to prevent the failure of the crop, made sacrifices, invoked and took to task the agricultural spirits ( lamoa nawu ) and even went to Pue mpalaburu to complain of the situation. The latter would then summon the agricultural spirits and berate them for letting the rice fail, for their job was only to look after the fields, the success of the harvest being his responsibility. These sando also had special methods for bringing rain, though there were a great variety of methods known to every one (III, 74). They did not limit their activities to their own villages, but were often called in by other villages which did not have a sando . Successful ones were treated with great respect. They were paid exclusively in rice, receiving from one to five percent of the harvest."" (Downs, 1956, p. 52)

'The 'agricultural leader' (tadulako mpodjamaa) led agricultural rituals for subgroups of the village:

""Apart from these 'doctors' there were two or three agricultural leaders, tadulako mpodjamaa, in each village. They were older men who were particularly skilled in this work and who had a good knowledge of the gods and spirits and the necessary rituals. They directed the activities of the various groups into which the villages were divided for cultivating the fields and made the offerings."" (Downs, 1956, p. 54)

The role of the headhunting leader (tadulako) is described briefly as follows:

""Still another figure with a religious function was the head-hunting leader (tadulako). His job was to act as intermediary between the men and the anitu, the ancestors primarily concerned with head-hunting (I, 259ff)."" (Downs, 1956, p. 54)

Finally, relationships with ancestors (upon whom most ritual was focused) was led by family heads and village chiefs:

The largest public rituals appear to have taken place on a village scale, based on Downs (1956, pp. 58-105), though people from other villages might be invited. A few examples follow:

Rituals connected with headhunting:

“A raiding party from a single village had a single leader, tadulako, who directed the whole operation. Larger groups usually had two leaders, one who directed the raid as a whole and a second one who led the actual attack. Sometimes a village chief went along, but then as the second leader. Most of the leaders of both kinds, however, were slaves. The tadulako was treated with great respect while in function and everything was done for him. He was responsible for all the members of the group and had to abstain from eating certain foods, doing certain things and using certain words while in enemy territory (I, 259ff.).” (Downs, 1956, p. 59)

‘Momparilangka’ (Downs, 1956, pp. 69-75)

""Similar to the head-hunting ritual, in many respects was the momparilangka or mompakawurake, an initiation ceremony for girls ..  It took place every three to five years (Kruyt, 1935b: 550), and though no special time of year is mentioned it would seem safe to assume that it fell in the slack period between harvest and planting, because of the extensive preparations it required and its duration … The ceremonies were performed either in the temple, as was the case with the western tribes, of which the To Pebato and To Wingke-mposo were the principal, or in a special hut ( bantaja ), which the eastern tribes, principally the To Lage and To Onda’e, erected for the occasion. The To Palande and To Lamusa, on the other hand, used the temple if they had one in the village or built a hut if they didn’t … Girls from other villages of the same tribe could participate, and this was done if there were too few of them in their own villages to justify putting on a momparilangka there or if a child had remained sickly and it was felt desirable to repeat the ceremony.” (Downs, 1956, pp. 69-70)

Agricultural rituals (Downs, 1956, pp. 91-100)

“The times to start clearing the forest for the new fields and for planting were determined by the positions of the constellation Tamangkapa … Before the work could begin the sins of the community had to be floated down the river (moandu sala) 28 . This was a simplified version of the morambu langi , which was performed for serious [93] cases of incest (see below, under B.). The same gods were invoked at it, however: Pue mpalaburu, Indo mtegolili and Ndara. It was usually done by the village as a whole under the leadership of a ladulako mpodjamaa , though occasionally it was performed by a single group of families or even one family, particularly if it had been postponed till the planting (III, 20ff.).

“We have seen that for the purpose of tilling the fields the people were divided into work groups which worshipped different spirits and followed different practices. In addition they were further divided into followers of the 'three', 'four', 'five' or 'seven' 'customs' (wua) ). The differences between them consisted mainly in doing everything in the fields by threes, fours, fives or sevens. The adherents of the 'four' and 'five' 'customs' were by far in the majority (III, 34).” (Downs, 1956, pp. 92-93)

“The next day (this sometimes preceded and sometimes coincided with the harvest feast) the molinga was ended with the mopasangke . Two poles about three meters high were erected three to four meters apart. They were called ambarale (which probably referred [Page 98] originally to the two miniature houses which used to be set up instead of the poles), toko mpajope , “pole of descent”, or toko sora , “decorated pole”. Cross bars were attached to the tops of the poles and presents hung from them, those for the women on one pole and those for the men on the other. In addition the ritual clothes (ajapa lamoa) of the shaman and harvest leader were hung on the one and those worn by the men at the head-hunting feasts on the other. The youths and girls who had taken part in the molinga sat around the poles and the rest of the villagers ranged themselves around them in a wide circle."" (Downs, 1956, p. 97)

Elsewhere, it is noted that one of the many Eastern Toraja tribes had a 'tribal' temple:

“The various tribes did not form organized political units. There were no tribal chiefs or functionaries of any kind native to Toradja society, with the possible exception of Onda’e (see below). The members of one tribe, however, were all conscious of being related and of having the same mother village, for which the tribes were often named, and several tribes, at any rate (specifically mentioned were Bantjea, Onda’e and Palande - I, 24f.; Kruyt, 1906: 224f.), had tribal regalia. They joined together for common purposes, especially against their enemies, and they attended each other’s death feasts, etc., but apart from this the villages were independent of each other (I, 109f.) ... [4] ...The tribes did, however, recognize a higher authority in the rulers of the kingdoms of Luwu and Mori. The To Pada and To Pakambia (those to the east of the Jaentu River, at any rate - those to the west of it sometimes recognized Mori and sometimes Luwu) came under Mori and the rest under Luwu. Of the two the more important was the datu of Luwu, the datu ri tana of Mori having formerly been his vassal (I, 119, 129ff., 60). His authority was, to be sure, only nominal according to western standards, as he merely required a small tribute in goods every once in a while...and contributions of buffalo for court feasts. He did, however, also call on his subjects from time to time for help in wars against other kingdoms, which the Toradja were usually quite ready to provide. So long as the tribes carried out the above duties the datu paid little attention to them … The datu of Luwu gave the title of karadja or tongko (called mokole by the Toradja) to the village chiefs of Tamungku (Pebato), Towale (Wingke-mposo), Pantjawu-enu (Lamusa) and Tando-mbeaga (Onda’e) with the duty of collecting tribute and transmitting it to him (I, 118). It was said that the To Onda’e, alone of these tribes, had had a paramount chief before the karadja was appointed by Luwu, though there is no proof of this, the whole institution possibly having been evolved under the influence of Luwu...). Although Kruyt said that the To Onda’e were the only tribe having a paramount chief, he spoke elsewhere of 'the chief of the To Pada', and since they apparently had only one temple for the whole tribe, at Perere, it is possible that this held for them as well (Kruyt, 1907; 870; 1899b; 207).

17756,iban,84,2,149-2,"'Religious personnel' (Jensen, 1974, pp. 59-64). 

Four positions are described: tuai burong, tuai rumah, lemambang, and manang. The tuai burong was clearly the most important, and acted as the religious leader of the longhouse:

“The personnel of Iban religion, the experts, are those individuals who have specific roles in relation to rice cultivation, augury, ritual celebrations and the ordering of society. They act as a channel between the world of immediate experience and its spirit antecedents and influences. The leading exponents of these roles in Iban society are four, although one or more functions may be vested in the same person. They are the tuai burong or augur, the tuai rumah or village headman, the lemambang or ritual incantation specialist, and, lastly, the manang--shaman or 'healer'."" (Jensen, 1974, p 59)

""The most important person in everyday life is the tuai burong (see below, pp. 135, 159-63). He is a man of considerable standing in his own village and in certain cases his reputation may extend much farther afield … The tuai burong is the augur, but he is not merely an augury expert. He is, above all, favoured with the spirit attention which expresses itself regularly in omens and dreams … The tuai burong , through his dreams, his augury, and in his ritual activities, leads the community, and because he is responsible for the omen sticks (megai kayu burong) he is known as the foundation or base of the longhouse (pun rumah) … The tuai burong leads the longhouse community in most daily religious matters and especially those concerning rice cultivation."" (Jensen, 1974, p 60)

The functions of the tuai rumah appear to have been mostly secular (though the tuai rumah was often also the tuai burong):

""Administration of customary law and the social code as such, the adat in its restricted and technical sense, falls to the tuai rumah (see above, pp. 25 seq.). Unlike the office of tuai burong, the tuai rumah is officially recognized by the government, although the position carries no emoluments. The functions of tuai rumah and tuai burong are distinct, but in practice it is often the same man who performs both."" (Jensen, 1974, p 61)

The lemambang specialised in ritual incantations at gawai (ceremonies), and appear to have been less important than the tuai burong. It is not clear whether there was typically one or more lemambang per longhouse. The ceremonies at which they officiated were presumably confined to the longhouse – gawai are described as varying 'in scope and significance … from the minor celebrations of individual families to the gawai kenyalang which takes an entire community many months of intensive preparation'."" (Jensen, 1974, p 195). 

“The lemambang may perhaps be called a priest but he is not the ultimate authority on Iban religion. His concern is with intoning the ritual incantations, called pengap, which form a central part of major ceremonies (gawai). These occur intermittently. Although extremely important, they are not as significant in the context of day-to-day religion as are omens, dreams, and social ordinances.” (Jensen, 1964, p 62)

The manang (healers) were served individuals rather than the community:

“The fourth category consists of the manang. Also these have been called ‘priests’ but, in fact, their functions are not priestly. They are healers, possibly shamans, whose role is related exclusively to treating the sick – understood to include the sick in both spirit and body …  Treatment is directed at individuals and the manang 's role is as a healer of individuals. Although individual illness may spring from wider bilek causes and have implications for the community, since Iban religion is in most respects essentially a bilek or community affair, the manang 's main contribution to an understanding of Iban conduct and belief lies in explaining the nature and behaviour of the spirit/soul and in interpreting sickness in man's relations with the spirit world.” (Jensen, 1974, pp 63-64)",jensen1974[59-64]
17755,hawaiians,86,3,150-3,"Structure of Hawaiian kingdoms:

“Traditional Hawaiian political and economic life was organized around a formal, nested hierarchy of units (Kirch and Sahlins 1992). Each independent kingdom … included an entire island (mokupuni), sometimes with smaller subsidiary islands, which in turn was usually subdivided into either six or twelve districts, called moku … Moku in turn were segmented into a large number of smaller territorial units called ahupua’a … Ahupua’a typically ran from the coast to the upland forests, crosscutting the concentrically zonated resources of an island … Although they were central to Hawaiian economic organization, the ahupua’a were yet again divided into smaller segments called ‘ihi, each of which comprised multiple households and agricultural plots … This territorial land structure corresponded to an equally precise political and administrative hierarchy of overlords, consisting of ali’i of various grades, not to be confused with the hierarchical ranking system of chiefs described earlier. At the apex of the polity sat the king, the ali’i nui or ‘great ali’i’, sometimes called the mo’i. The ali’i nui ruled over the entire mokupuni, assisted by various administrative aides … The districts (moku) into which the kingdom was divided were each under the control of a major chief of high rank, called the ali’i-‘ai-moku. The operative term ‘ai in this compound term has the core meaning of both ‘food’ and ‘eat’ but with metaphoric extensions connoting to ‘consume,’ ‘grasp,’ or ‘hold onto’ (Pukui and Elbert 1986:9) ... In a parallel fashion, the more numerous ahupua’a territories were apportioned to chiefs who were called the ali’i-‘ai-ahupua’a, the chiefs who ‘ate’ the ahupua’a. Low-ranked chiefs might hold just a single, marginal land unit, but more powerful and higher-ranked ali’i frequently held more than one ahupua’a. ... As was common in many dynastic states (Elias 1983), the central administration was effectively one and the same as the royal household, an incipient bureaucracy embedded within the king’s extended residential group. Malo (1951:187– 88) lays out the dualistic structure of this administrative body, referring to the ‘two strong forces, or parties, in the government’: the kahuna nui or chief priest on the one hand, and the kālaimoku , or chief councilor, on the other. The functions of the kahuna nui and other subsidiary priests will be considered in detail later. The kālaimoku was charged with advising the king on all secular affairs, including war. Among his chief duties was to oversee the royal storehouses ‘in which to collect food, fish, tapa [barkcloth], malo [loincloths], pa-u [female skirts], and all sorts of goods’ (Malo 1951:195). Only the kālaimoku had the regular privilege of holding secret meetings with the king, and he controlled the access of other ali‘i to royal audiences. As Kepelino makes clear in his own account of ‘the government,’ the Hawaiian system was highly decentralized, or distributed. While the king ‘was the supreme head,’ whose power was most clearly indicated by his ability to redistribute the moku and ahupua’a land divisions to the chiefs under his rule, the daily management of these hierarchically nested lands rested largely in the hands of the konohiki (Beckwith 1932:146). ‘The Konohiki took charge of farm lands and sought means to benefit their overlords and chiefs.’.

18625,aneityum,85,1,151-1,"Missionary sources consistently describe religious and political authority as closely linked on Aneityum, but even the same authors are inconsistent on some of the details of how they were linked. At least least in theory, a distinction existed between 'chiefs'  on the one hand and 'priests' (also known as 'sacred men', 'sorcerers' etc.) on the other. These categories overlapped greatly, but it would seem not completely. According to some of the excerpts below 'all' chiefs were also priests, but according to others chiefs were only 'generally' or 'for the most part' priests. Whether it was possible to be a 'priest' without being a 'chief' is unclear. However, the supreme religious position of the 'high chief' (natimarid) seems reasonably clear. 

Overview:

“It is often stressed in the missionary accounts that the 'civil' role of chiefs was inextricably bound up with their 'sacred' role  ... Thus natimarid were described as 'high priests' or priest-sorcerers renowned as disease-makers, rain-makers, fish-makers, fruit and crop-makers, famine-makers and so on. Other priest-sorcerers, a 'numerous and influential' group, were usually also natimi alupas. The sorcerer's role was also a hereditary one (ibid: items 19b, 45), and Inglis went so far as to state that great warriors or disease-makers, 'being most dreaded, possessed greatest influence' … Chiefly power was thus based, as in many small-scale chiefdoms ... on ritual rather than physically coercive powers - power of sorcery against enemies, power over the elements to control success in agriculture and fishing."" (Spriggs, 1981, p. 59)

Quotes from missionaries and visitors:

“As the chiefs are all priests or sacred men, devoted to their respective Nat-masses, the influence against us is formidable ... Every chief is either a disease maker, a rain maker, a fish maker, a fruit maker, etc, and to his sacerdotal office, which is supposed to include these extraordinary powers, he is more indebted for his influence over the people than to his chieftainship.” (Geddie, 1852, quoted in Spriggs, 1981, App. 6.2)

“The island is divided politically into six principal districts, and each of these into about ten or twelve sub-districts, each of the sub-districts is governed by a chief. In the days of heathenism, there was a chief for each of the principal districts; but his office appears, from all we can learn, to have been more of the priestly than the kingly character, though both offices were generally combined in the same person.” (Inglis, 1855, quoted in Spriggs, 1981, App. 6.6)

“Chiefs. In each of the six districts there is usually a chief - called Natimarith (literally 'High Man'), or Natimi-ahales-ahales, which latter appellation alludes to the circumstance that he alone is entitled to be carried on men's shoulders ...  Priests. The class of priests was called Elpatimi etaup (meaning 'sacred men') ... The priests were usually petty chiefs and the office of priesthood was to a certain extent hereditary."" (MacGillivray, 1853, quoted in Spriggs, 1981, App. 6.5)

“In the days of heathenism every chief appeared to have exercised authority in his own district, and there was no general union among them. The chiefs were for the most part sacred men, and were supposed to possess supernatural powers such as making sickness and death, controlling the elements,  causing famines or fruitful crops at pleasure.” (Geddie, 1854, quoted in Spriggs, 1981, p. 6.7)

“In the days of heathenism the island was divided into seven districts, governed by as many high chiefs, whose power was supreme. They were the high priests as well us civil rulers of the island.” (Geddie, 1862, quoted in Spriggs, 1981, App. 6.11)

“When the mission work was begun on Aneityum, the island was governed by six principal chiefs, and about fifty under chiefs. The name of a principal chief was Natimarith, from Natimi, man, and arith, high; a secondary chief was called Natimi alupas, from Natimi, man, and alupas, great, In heathen times the duties of the priesthood were discharged chiefly by the Natimariths. Each Natimarith, in his own district, was a kind of Pontifex Maximus, or high priest; he presided at feasts, and performed certain sacerdotal duties; but when heathenism came to an end, their priestly vocation also terminated, and their civil power alone remained; but it became very much increased when it became based upon Scriptural authority.” (Inglis, 1890, quoted in Spriggs, 1981, App. 6.14).

The principal function of the chief was to provide feasts. The ostensible function of feasts appears to have been religious, though they also served to increase the prestige of those who provided them. In relation to feasts, chiefs also had 'political' authority in that they had a right to direct preparations for these feasts.  

“It is in the practice of feasting (so strongly condemned by the missionaries) that Aneityumese social structure and the position of chiefs is most clear. The central role of chiefs was in the giving and receiving of feasts, involving the appropriation of surplus food production in their own chiefdoms or districts and redistributing across chiefdom or district boundaries … A chief's relative status was shown by the quantity of food collected and this was limited by the quantity he could appropriate from his own subjects. One way of concentrating food supplies for the feasts was the imposition of a taboo on certain foods leading up to it, backed up by fear of angering the chief as possessor of malevolent powers, and of angering the spirits (natmas) in general. On occasions more directly coercive sanctions were employed to enforce taboos … [65] … this fear was tempered by an ideology of giving. Thus, 'it was one of the primary articles in the creed of heathenism, that the man who made the most costly offering to the natmasses, most effectually propitiated their favour' (App· 8: item 14) , and 'their highest ambition was to make a great exhibition of 1ood' (ibid: item 12) … Within the district therefore, status could be assigned to the individual who produced the greatest quantity of food, successfully propitiating both chief and natmas. The chief carried this desire for status lo the inter-district arena, where an impressive display of food showed that his garden magic was more powerful therefore his propitiation of the natmas more successful, and his control over agricultural production more effective than his rivals.” (Spriggs, 1981, pp. 64-65)

One source describes a 'tribal council' which is not mentioned elsewhere. This council is destribed as punishing 'all infractions of tribal law'. Although the members of this council are described as being under the 'jurisdiction' of the natimarid, his exact role in it is not clear.

""The tribal council consisted of the head men of each village
or hamlet under the jurisdiction of each high chief. All infractions
of tribal law were discussed, and punished by the arms being bound and the culprit left for several hours to the public gaze, also by his getting growing food uprooted to ·feed the council ..."" (Lawrie, 1892, quoted in Spriggs, 1981, App. 6.15)","spriggs-1981[59-60, 64-65]"

17732,eastern-sumbanese,84,3,149-3,"The eastern Sumbanese were divided into ‘domains’, which consisted of multiple villages:

""The population of Eastern Sumba is divided among numerous, typically small and (in former times) largely autonomous traditional domains each comprising a number of distinguishable villages and hamlets and inhabited by segments of a number of patrilineal clans ... The domain is called tana or paraingu ... Apart from indicating the territory as a whole, paraingu is also used to refer specifically to the chief village of a domain ... This double meaning of the term is consistent with a traditional pattern of settlement found throughout eastern Sumba, in which the ancestral houses and graves of the ruling nobility and commoner clans longest established in the [46] domain are located in the chief village. The pattern varies from place to place, however; and in Rindi, besides the houses of the noble clan, only those of four commoner clans which hold special ritual duties were ever situated in the principal village of the domain ... The majority of Rindi clans have thus always resided in subsidiary villages that surround the chief village."" (Forth, 1981, pp 45-46)

Forth (1981, pp 235-264) discusses the ‘division of authority’ in Rindi and other East Sumbanese domains in detail. The typical pattern was a division of authority between two groups of clans called maramba and ratu, the former having ‘temporal’ authority and the latter religious. These statuses, it might be emphasised, belonged to clans rather than to individuals. 

“While a separation of two sorts of authority can be discerned in various contexts of eastern Sumbanese social and conceptual order, its clearest expression is found in a dual partition of leadership functions between lineal descent groups within the domain, the most inclusive level of political and territorial integration … Since the pattern is rather less pronounced in Rindi than elsewhere, however, it is useful first to outline a more elaborate form that appears in the neighbouring domain of Umalulu …  Temporal power and spiritual leadership in Umalulu are divided between the noble rulers (maramba) and the ratu, the highest religious authorities. Rindi differs from this domain in that the latter office is formally absent there. Contrary to the impression conveyed by some earlier writings on Sumba, in Umalulu the title of ratu applies not exclusively to a particular individual leader, but collectively to a number of clans; and all members of these clans can be called ratu. Another potential source of confusion is the translation of ratu as 'priest' (see Wielenga 1909a:307), since this word is more appropriately used to designate elders (ama bokulu), of any clan, who engage in priestly duties. As noted, unlike ratu, this is not an hereditary office but a vocation requiring no more than age and experience."" (Forth, 1981, p 237). 

Roles of the ratu and maramba clans:

“Due to the abandonment of the chief village in Umalulu and the consequent neglect of customary undertakings that once required the concerted involvement of the two sorts of leaders, it is now difficult to determine what precisely were their roles in specific situations. [242] From what I was told, however, it seems that in general the ratu, by virtue of their authority and expertise in customary and religious matters, informed decisions formally taken by the two leaders together, which were then expedited by the maràmba. While the noble rulers might initiate projects, the prior approval of the ratu for any undertaking was necessary in order to secure for it the divine sanction of the ancestor (see Wielenga 1909c:371). In matters that concerned only their own particular spheres of influence, however, it seems the maràmba acted mostly independently of the ratu. Thus the secular leaders, by contrast to the spiritual leaders, can be said to represent segmentary interests. This, too, finds expression in spatial terms. In accordance with the superiority of Palai Malamba to Watu Pelitu .... Palai Malamba and Watu Pelitu govern respectively the upstream and downstream halves of the entire territory of the domain.

“As is consistent with their separation from secular concerns, the four ratu clans, occupying the central section of the village, do not figure in this dual division of the territory. While they have agricultural lands outside the village, these are found in the upstream half of the domain, controlled by Palai Malamba … so the ratu's sphere of influence is confined to the chief village itself and then specifically to the centre. As accords with their occupation of the outer sections of the village, the nobles, on the other hand, are mainly concerned with external affairs, which in former times included the defence of the village, and especially the centre, against attack, and waging war on other domains. The latter activity, as I was told, was one means by which the nobles accumulated wealth in the form of slaves and goods, and so in this respect became vastly superior to the ratu. The ratu and the maràmba may therefore be characterized as oriented upwards and outwards respectively: the former are concerned with 'vertical' relations between man and spirit, and the latter with 'horizontal' relations among groups of men.” (Forth, 1981, pp 241-242)

Role of the ratu in domain-level ceremonies:

“Much of what has been said above concerning the ratu refers specifically or especially to the principal member, Watu Waya, and I have yet to discuss how the four ratu clans are distinguished among themselves. The groups comprise two pairs: Watu Waya and Muru Uma, and Ongga and Marapeti. The former pair is superior to the latter, and Watu Waya and Marapeti are the senior members of their respective pairs … By contrast to the other two ratu, in ritual matters Watu Waya and Muru Uma are expected only to take decisions and to issue instructions  ...[244]  ... Hence the division of active and passive between the two pairs of ratu clans replicates that between the maràmba and the ratu as a whole. The fact that Muru Uma is assigned the special task of summoning (paaungu) the other clans of the domain to attend collective rites which concern the uma nda pataungu might be taken as an indication that this clan is marginally more active than Watu Waya. But otherwise there is little difference in function between the two; and I suspect that the main reason they are distinguished is simply to effect a quadripartition of the ratu clans. The more active role in ceremonial life, therefore, is taken by the junior ratu, in particular by Marapeti; so once again, superior and inferior are contrasted as inactive and active respectively.” (Forth, 1981, pp 243-244)

In Rindi the situation was different. There were no ratu clans, but secular and religious authority were divided between different lineages of the same clan:

""As noted above, an important difference between Umalulu and Rindi is that the office of ratu is formally absent in the latter domain ... This does not mean, however, that there is no separation of secular and religious authority in Rindi, but only that it is differently expressed. Specifically, the division is manifest within the Rindi noble clan itself, between the lineages Uma Penji and Uma Jangga. The former, which is the highest ranking of the six noble lineages of Ana Mburungu, is the secular leader both within the clan and throughout the domain; thus men of Uma Penji were appointed as district administrators by the Dutch. As regards ceremonial concerns, on the other hand, greater authority is accorded to Uma Janggak, whose members are in generally considered to belong to the lower nobility (maramba kudu)."" (Forth, 1981, p. 254)

Like the ratu and máramba clans elsewhere in East Sumba, Uma Janggak and Uma Penji were considered genealogically senior and junior respectively. However, unlike in other domains, there is no indication that the religious leaders were considered superior (indeed, the reverse may have been the case):

“The apical ancestors of Uma Jangga and Uma Penji were both sons of Umbu Nggala Lili, the common forbear of all noble members of Ana Mburungu (see Fig. 7). Uma Jangga, however, descends from the eldest son of Nggala Lili's first wife, a woman from the Umalulu noble clan Palai Malamba, while the Uma Penji ancestor was a child of a later wife, a noblewoman from Tabundungu. The difference in rank between Uma Penji and Uma Jangga ultimately derives from the fact that the second wife was of somewhat higher standing than the first … As their ancestors are distinguished as elder and younger and, in terms of class, as lower and higher, therefore, the relation between these two lineages is precisely the same as that between Watu Waya and Palai Malamba, the principal ratu and maràmba in Umalulu. Perhaps what we encounter in Rindi, then, is a nascent form of the more developed pattern of dual leadership found in longer established domains.” (Forth, 1981, p 254)

“The house of Uma Penji, the temporal leader in Rindi, is found at the upstream end of the village, while that of Uma Jangga, the ceremonial authority, is placed at the downstream end, both in the principal row of houses (see Chapter II). That the ceremonial authority should apparently occupy the inferior of the two outer sections thus suggests an important difference between the organization of the chief villages in Rindi and Umalulu; and it is in accordance with this that Uma Jangga is not recognized as ultimately superior to Uma Penji in the same way as the Umalulu ratu are regarded as superior to the maràmba.” (Forth, 1981, p 256)

Role of Uma Jangga in domain-wide ceremonies:

“In its capacity as the ceremonial authority, Uma Jangga is called 'the red jar, the green urn' (mbàlu rara, kihi muru). The phrases also refer to the group's spokesman. Traditionally this was the most senior man, but it has more recently become the practice among the nobles to appoint someone of Uma Jangga (or the derivative lineage, Uma Kopi) to fill the position by virtue of his individual ability and knowledge of custom ... [255] ... It is he who presides over all major ritual undertakings that concern the noble clan (and hence, often, the domain as a whole), and meetings at which preparations for these are discussed take place in Uma Jangga's principal house.” (Forth, 1981, pp 254-255)",forth1981[235-264]

“While a separation of two sorts of authority can be discerned in various contexts of eastern Sumbanese social and conceptual order, its clearest expression is found in a dual partition of leadership functions between lineal descent groups within the domain, the most inclusive level of political and territorial integration … Since the pattern is rather less pronounced in Rindi than elsewhere, however, it is useful first to outline a more elaborate form that appears in the neighbouring domain of Umalulu …  Temporal power and spiritual leadership in Umalulu are divided between the noble rulers (maramba) and the ratu, the highest religious authorities. Rindi differs from this domain in that the latter office is formally absent there. Contrary to the impression conveyed by some earlier writings on Sumba, in Umalulu the title of ratu applies not exclusively to a particular individual leader, but collectively to a number of clans; and all members of these clans can be called ratu. Another potential source of confusion is the translation of ratu as 'priest' (see Wielenga 1909a:307), since this word is more appropriately used to designate elders (ama bokulu), of any clan, who engage in priestly duties. As noted, unlike ratu, this is not an hereditary office but a vocation requiring no more than age and experience."" (Forth, 1981, p 237). 

Roles of the ratu and maramba clans:

“Due to the abandonment of the chief village in Umalulu and the consequent neglect of customary undertakings that once required the concerted involvement of the two sorts of leaders, it is now difficult to determine what precisely were their roles in specific situations. [242] From what I was told, however, it seems that in general the ratu, by virtue of their authority and expertise in customary and religious matters, informed decisions formally taken by the two leaders together, which were then expedited by the maràmba. While the noble rulers might initiate projects, the prior approval of the ratu for any undertaking was necessary in order to secure for it the divine sanction of the ancestor (see Wielenga 1909c:371). In matters that concerned only their own particular spheres of influence, however, it seems the maràmba acted mostly independently of the ratu. Thus the secular leaders, by contrast to the spiritual leaders, can be said to represent segmentary interests. This, too, finds expression in spatial terms. In accordance with the superiority of Palai Malamba to Watu Pelitu .... Palai Malamba and Watu Pelitu govern respectively the upstream and downstream halves of the entire territory of the domain.

“As is consistent with their separation from secular concerns, the four ratu clans, occupying the central section of the village, do not figure in this dual division of the territory. While they have agricultural lands outside the village, these are found in the upstream half of the domain, controlled by Palai Malamba … so the ratu's sphere of influence is confined to the chief village itself and then specifically to the centre. As accords with their occupation of the outer sections of the village, the nobles, on the other hand, are mainly concerned with external affairs, which in former times included the defence of the village, and especially the centre, against attack, and waging war on other domains. The latter activity, as I was told, was one means by which the nobles accumulated wealth in the form of slaves and goods, and so in this respect became vastly superior to the ratu. The ratu and the maràmba may therefore be characterized as oriented upwards and outwards respectively: the former are concerned with 'vertical' relations between man and spirit, and the latter with 'horizontal' relations among groups of men.” (Forth, 1981, pp 241-242)

Formal superiority of the ratu to the máramba:

“In accordance with the values attached to the three main parts of the village as discussed in Chapter II, therefore, the spatial arrangement of groups within the chief village of Umalulu expresses both the superiority of the ratu to the maràmba and that of the senior to the junior maràmba clan. The former relation, however, pertains mainly to ritual, for in terms of worldly power, the nobles, with their many slaves and clients, greatly overshadow the religious leaders … As regards secular concerns, then, the order of precedence among these groups is precisely the reverse of what obtains in the framework of spiritual values. Yet it is generally clear that for the eastern Sumbanese the spiritual is ultimately superior to the temporal - indeed, what can be called the spiritual (in this case especially the ancestor, Umbu Endalu) is the source of both sorts of powers - so it is this principle that governs the order expressed both in myth and in the arrangement of the village. The Umalulu people thus say that the ratu is the superior of the two sorts of leaders, and that they are the one party to whom the nobility must pay heed.” (Forth, 1981, p 243)

Myths suggest that in the distant past, the ratu had secular as well as religious authority, but that the former was subsequently usurped – variations on this myth are common in eastern Indonesia (Forth, 1981, pp 245-247).

In Rindi the situation was different. There were no ratu clans, but secular and religious authority were divided between different lineages of the same clan.

""As noted above, an important difference between Umalulu and Rindi is that the office of ratu is formally absent in the latter domain ... This does not mean, however, that there is no separation of secular and religious authority in Rindi, but only that it is differently expressed. Specifically, the division is manifest within the Rindi noble clan itself, between the lineages Uma Penji and Uma Jangga. The former, which is the highest ranking of the six noble lineages of Ana Mburungu, is the secular leader both within the clan and throughout the domain; thus men of Uma Penji were appointed as district administrators by the Dutch. As regards ceremonial concerns, on the other hand, greater authority is accorded to Uma Janggak, whose members are in generally considered to belong to the lower nobility (maramba kudu)."" (Forth, 1981, p. 254).

Like the ratu and máramba clans elsewhere in East Sumba, Uma Janggak and Uma Penji were considered genealogically senior and junior respectively. However, unlike in other domains, there is no indication that the religious leaders were considered superior (indeed, the reverse may have been the case):

“The apical ancestors of Uma Jangga and Uma Penji were both sons of Umbu Nggala Lili, the common forbear of all noble members of Ana Mburungu (see Fig. 7). Uma Jangga, however, descends from the eldest son of Nggala Lili's first wife, a woman from the Umalulu noble clan Palai Malamba, while the Uma Penji ancestor was a child of a later wife, a noblewoman from Tabundungu. The difference in rank between Uma Penji and Uma Jangga ultimately derives from the fact that the second wife was of somewhat higher standing than the first … As their ancestors are distinguished as elder and younger and, in terms of class, as lower and higher, therefore, the relation between these two lineages is precisely the same as that between Watu Waya and Palai Malamba, the principal ratu and maràmba in Umalulu. Perhaps what we encounter in Rindi, then, is a nascent form of the more developed pattern of dual leadership found in longer established domains.” (Forth, 1981, p 254)

“The house of Uma Penji, the temporal leader in Rindi, is found at the upstream end of the village, while that of Uma Jangga, the ceremonial authority, is placed at the downstream end, both in the principal row of houses (see Chapter II). That the ceremonial authority should apparently occupy the inferior of the two outer sections thus suggests an important difference between the organization of the chief villages in Rindi and Umalulu; and it is in accordance with this that Uma Jangga is not recognized as ultimately superior to Uma Penji in the same way as the Umalulu ratu are regarded as superior to the maràmba.” (Forth, 1981, p 256)",forth1981[235-264]

'Magic' (Jenness & Ballantyne, 1920, pp. pp 133-144)

'Religion' (Jenness & Ballantyne, 1920, pp. pp 145-153)

The only ritual specialists mentioned by Jenness and Ballantyne are various magicians (‘singers’), whose magic mostly involved gardening, and certain women who could communicate with the dead. 

Magicians usually appear to have operated at the hamlet level, though sometimes their influence would extend further. Often they were hamlet headmen (kauvea), but not necessarily. The position of ‘singer’ does not appear to have been an ‘office’ viz. ‘a standardised set of duties and privileges devolving upon a person in a certain situation’ (Hughes, 1937). Rather, singers simply appear to have been individuals with the right knowledge and equipment, which could in theory be acquired by anyone:

""Nearly every hamlet has its professional ‘singer’, a man who knows the proper incantation for the yams, and sometimes too for taro, sweet potatoes and bananas. Often, however, there is a separate ‘singer’ for each of these. When all is ready for the planting the ‘singer’ takes a special stone which he keeps stored away in his hut, and over it he sings an incantation."" (Jenness & Ballantyne, 1920, p 123)

""Incantations, it will be noticed, play a large part in native life. Almost every native knows at least one incantation. There are incantations for the sunshine and the rain, for raising the wind and for making it subside again, for calming a stormy sea, for ensuring success in hunting and in fishing, for producing disease and sickness and again for healing these; in fact there is not one single sphere of man’s activity in which an incantation cannot help him. The man who knows a successful incantation can always be sure of driving a lucrative trade and securing the ordinary articles of wealth. But the number of really accredited singers in any hamlet is not large. Mud Bay, for example, has only two rain-makers, Naialena, the head man of Vakoiya hamlet in Kabuna, and Kabuaola, the head man of a Faiyavi hamlet; both of these obtained their knowledge from their fathers … Of the other magicians in and around Mud Bay, Malabuya, the old man of Lobonea, can make the lighting and the thunder; Maginavina, of Akaiyadiya, can raise the wind or cause a calm; and Tadobuya, the head man of Kimokimoiyo, knows the incantation that should be sung before a pig hunt.""(Jenness & Ballantyne, 1920, pp 127-128)

""The greatest ruler of the winds and rain and sunshine, though, was an ancient pot. It belonged to Tomeawala, head man of one of the two Inafani hamlets that lie on the top of a ridge overlooking Mud Bay and Wagifa … [130] … From Kukuya to Nuatutu this pot held sovereign sway, and from time to time Tomeawala and his friends descended to the coast and levied tribute. The natives dared not refuse to pay, lest their gardens should be scorched up by a drought and they themselves should die of famine."" (Jenness & Ballantyne, 1920, pp 129-130)

""Generally it is the head man of the hamlet who is skilled in incantations. It is he who in most places names the new canoe and sings the incantation before a pig or kangaroo hunt; and in olden times it was he who led the war-party on his expeditions. Now his authority is slight, but formerly it seems to have been much greater."" (Jenness & Ballantyne, 1920, p 131)

On the second category of religious practitioner ('necromancers'):

“Most of the natives appear to acquiesce in the vague belief that the souls of the dead without distinction go to Wafolo, and some perhaps to Tuma ... One native told us [147] that the souls of the dead sometimes return at sunset to visit their former habitations, but are invisible to mortal eyes. There are certain women, too, who have power to call them back. The most famous of these in recent times was Viataiata, in Mitaita, the same woman who was once caught digging up a corpse. Often when a man died in one of the neighbouring districts his kinsfolk would cook a large quantity of food and take it to Oiaia, her hamlet in the hills. At night a mat was set across her house dividing the men from the women. Then Viataiata gave them food to eat, and the soul (maiau) of the dead man, hidden save for one hand and forearm, ate and talked with them. After the feast the kinsfolk said farewell to the soul and shook its hand or forearm, taking care never to lay hold above the elbow lest the arm should break off. The soul then returned to its home in the same way as it came, on the back of a shark.

“Viataiata no longer calls up the dead. We asked her why, and she said that an old man at Gauyaba in the centre of the island had forbidden them ever to appear again … The old Gauyaba man who will never die has put an end to Viataiata's necromancy. Unkind neighbours sometimes whisper that fear of the Government has had more to do with [148] it, but surely the reason she herself gives must carry greater credence. After she had retired another woman set up in practice at Wagifa, where there was a Dobuan mission teacher and his wife. Her methods, however, were rather too transparent.” (Jenness & Ballantyne, 1920, pp. 146-148)",jenness-ballantyne1920[109-153];hughes1937

19758,kodi,84,3,149-3,"“The highest-ranking priest in Kodi was a ‘Father Time’ figure, the Rato Nale, or ""Lord of the Year."" In Tossi, the ritual center of the domain, this office was held by Ra Holo, a patient and considerate host to me on my many visits … His counterpart in the outlying village of Bukubani, Ra Ndengi, agreed to narrate certain myths and allow me to observe the ceremonies of the new year; he was not, however, as reflective and questioning of his own task as Ra Holo.” (Hoskins, 1997, p. 10)

“The early 1960s were a time of great disorder and turmoil throughout the country, expressed in Kodi by the burning of several important ancestral villages – not only Tossi, but also Rangga Baki, home of Raja Horo, and five others that contained significant wealth and heirloom objects. Some of the suspected arsonists were described as ‘communists’; yet they, too, were engulfed in the blood of violence that spread over the country in 1965, after generals crushed a reported coup. At this point it is unclear just where local politics stopped and national politics began. Anyone who seemed to wield power or privilege was the object of assaults, with quick [133] retaliation a foregone conclusion. The result was to paralyze not only the national political system but also the local ceremonial cycle.

“The office of Rato Nale in Tossi remained vacant for much of the sixties as villages tried to summon the resources needed to perform a ceremony calling back the soul of each of the destroyed houses, which would permit them to be rebuilt. No one dared to assume the politically dangerous position of high priest lest further arson and attacks be the result. For almost a decade, therefore, Ra Ndengi alone performed the calendrical rites, ‘holding the year’ in place from his secluded home in Bukubani. The lapse in ritual performance created a sense of social fragmentation, and a loss of hierarchy. People no longer gathered for large-scale festivities, feasting and jousting to welcome the sea worms, but simply prayed in their isolated garden huts.

“In 1972, a divination was held in the newly rebuilt Tossi, and Ra Holo, the grandson of Mbiri Koni, was selected to become the new head priest.” (Hoskins, 1997, pp. 132-133)",hoskins1997[10]

The only religious specialists mentioned are mediums called mabayen if male, or makamong if female:

""Since most 'sicknesses' and 'hurts' were caused by malevolent spirits, or because a person broke a taboo or disregarded an omen, the way to avoid death or prolonged illness was to turn to a Ga’dang ritual specialist. Mediums, both male and female, were usually elderly, and addressed with terms of respect meaning 'old man' and 'old woman'. As previously mentioned, a male medium was a mabayen and female medium was a makamong. While there were both male and female mediums, the consensus was that women mediums had greater powers of divination and were more able to act as go-betweens in the spiritual world (Wallace 1975). Male mediums specialized in recounting myths and in singing and chanting ritual songs.

""Mediums among the Ga'dang, like those in most other hill groups of the Cordillera Central, were part time specialists ... [97] ... They had the same economic and social responsibilities as any other members of society. Because of their special capabilities, however, they had an elevated status in Ga’dang society. They were rewarded well for their services and were on demand throughout much of the year ... Mediums, especially women, served as effective go-betweens for humans and the spirits and deities that wandered between the kalekay and duafa of the ilosa."" (Wallace, 2013, pp 96-97)

On the second category of religious practitioner ('necromancers'):

“Most of the natives appear to acquiesce in the vague belief that the souls of the dead without distinction go to Wafolo, and some perhaps to Tuma ... One native told us [147] that the souls of the dead sometimes return at sunset to visit their former habitations, but are invisible to mortal eyes. There are certain women, too, who have power to call them back. The most famous of these in recent times was Viataiata, in Mitaita, the same woman who was once caught digging up a corpse. Often when a man died in one of the neighbouring districts his kinsfolk would cook a large quantity of food and take it to Oiaia, her hamlet in the hills. At night a mat was set across her house dividing the men from the women. Then Viataiata gave them food to eat, and the soul (maiau) of the dead man, hidden save for one hand and forearm, ate and talked with them. After the feast the kinsfolk said farewell to the soul and shook its hand or forearm, taking care never to lay hold above the elbow lest the arm should break off. The soul then returned to its home in the same way as it came, on the back of a shark.

“Viataiata no longer calls up the dead. We asked her why, and she said that an old man at Gauyaba in the centre of the island had forbidden them ever to appear again … The old Gauyaba man who will never die has put an end to Viataiata's necromancy. Unkind neighbours sometimes whisper that fear of the Government has had more to do with [148] it, but surely the reason she herself gives must carry greater credence. After she had retired another woman set up in practice at Wagifa, where there was a Dobuan mission teacher and his wife. Her methods, however, were rather too transparent.” (Jenness & Ballantyne, 1920, pp. 146-148)",jenness-ballantyne1920[109-153];hughes1937

Bwaidoga society consisted of ‘hamlets’ grouped into ‘districts’. Only the former appear to have had any kind of formal leadership in the form of a head man (kauvea).

""THE basis of the whole social structure on Goodenough is the family, which consists, as with us, of a man, his wife, and their descendants. The son, as soon as he reaches manhood, seeks a wife in another hamlet and leads her away to his own; the daughter, with rare exceptions, removes to the hamlet of her husband. Each hamlet, therefore, consists of a number of families closely connected with one another by ties of kinship. One man, the recognized head of the related families, is likewise the head man, kauvea, of the hamlet."" (Jenness & Ballantyne, 1920, p 63)

""Every inhabited district has a number of hamlets in it, usually five or six. Each of these contains from one to forty houses with a probable average of from two to three inmates. The hamlets are sometimes scattered over a considerable area, in extreme cases one may be a mile away from all the rest. But there is a tendency for them to keep close together, and sometimes they actually unite so that to a stranger there would seem to be but one hamlet."" (Jenness & Ballantyne, 1920, p 42)

It is not clear that kauvea was an office rather than a mere honorific. At one point Jenness and Ballantyne explicitly deny that this figure had any authority over and above that of any influential man, though at another point they suggest that this was not the case previously. 

""DESPITE all their taboos, the natives have never been inspired with a faith strong enough to make them keep the law and respect their neighbours’ property … There is no central authority to take cognisance of offences, no all-powerful chief to sit in judgement. The kauvea or head man of a hamlet has only the influence which a man of years and experience is sure to command everywhere, but of actual recognized authority he has none. It is not he who decides the disputes and quarrels but the rival parties themselves, aided at time by mediating friends; and only the fear of social ostracism compels compliance with the general will."" (Jenness & Ballantyne, 1920, p 76)

""Generally it is the head man of the hamlet who is skilled in incantations. It is he who in most places names the new canoe and sings the incantation before a pig or kangaroo hunt; and in olden times it was he who led the war-party on his expeditions. Now his authority is slight, but formerly it seems to have been much greater … [132] … A few of the older head men still retain a considerably show of dignity and authority. Abela, of Inaofole hamlet in Kabuna, Alumeko, in Wagifa, would command respect everywhere. But in most cases such authority as they may once have possessed has utterly disappeared. External signs of authority they never possessed, not even a finer hut or a special seat on a stone platform."" (Jenness & Ballantyne, 1920, pp. 131-132)","jenness-ballantyne1920[63-75, 131-132]"

“Traditional Hawaiian political and economic life was organized around a formal, nested hierarchy of units (Kirch and Sahlins 1992). Each independent kingdom … included an entire island (mokupuni), sometimes with smaller subsidiary islands, which in turn was usually subdivided into either six or twelve districts, called moku … Moku in turn were segmented into a large number of smaller territorial units called ahupua’a … Ahupua’a typically ran from the coast to the upland forests, crosscutting the concentrically zonated resources of an island … Although they were central to Hawaiian economic organization, the ahupua’a were yet again divided into smaller segments called ‘ihi, each of which comprised multiple households and agricultural plots … This territorial land structure corresponded to an equally precise political and administrative hierarchy of overlords, consisting of ali’i of various grades, not to be confused with the hierarchical ranking system of chiefs described earlier. At the apex of the polity sat the king, the ali’i nui or ‘great ali’i’, sometimes called the mo’i. The ali’i nui ruled over the entire mokupuni, assisted by various administrative aides … The districts (moku) into which the kingdom was divided were each under the control of a major chief of high rank, called the ali’i-‘ai-moku. The operative term ‘ai in this compound term has the core meaning of both ‘food’ and ‘eat’ but with metaphoric extensions connoting to ‘consume,’ ‘grasp,’ or ‘hold onto’ (Pukui and Elbert 1986:9) ... In a parallel fashion, the more numerous ahupua’a territories were apportioned to chiefs who were called the ali’i-‘ai-ahupua’a, the chiefs who ‘ate’ the ahupua’a. Low-ranked chiefs might hold just a single, marginal land unit, but more powerful and higher-ranked ali’i frequently held more than one ahupua’a.”  (Kirch, 2010, pp 47-48)",valeri1985[140];kirch2010[47-48]

'Religious personnel' (Jensen, 1974, pp. 59-64)

Traditionally, Iban longhouses were politically independent. Each longhouse had a 'headman', tuai rumah. The tuai rumah had little power, but acted as the nominal head of a 'court' that settled disputes between longhouse members. The role of the tuai rumah was in large part religious - disputes needed to be resolved to restore the 'spiritual harmony' of the longhouse:

“According to its geographical extent and size of its population (also, in some cases, the terrain), each river valley has one or more local ‘chiefs’. These are called Penghulu which, in Iban, means literally ‘one who leads’. In the traditional Iban context there was no area leader, and the title was used only of those who led head-hunting expeditions (gayau) or mass migrations (pindah). The modern office of Penghulu was introduced by the Brooke Rajahs and has since become part of Iban administration.” (Jensen, 1974, p. 23)

“Each longhouse has a headman (tuai rumah) chosen by a consensus of the people in his village. Although he receives no salary, the government officially recognizes the tuai rumah and considers him the spokesman for his longhouse and representative of the community. The tuai rumah , however, is a primus inter pares with no authority to issue orders. In spite of this, he is responsible for arbitrating in disputes which occur within the longhouse community and may impose fines not exceeding $16. As a ‘chairman’ he presides and maintains order over the court which is attended by all parties directly involved in litigation as well as anyone who happens to be interested. Although, when the tuai rumah is a respected member of the community and a forceful speaker, his influence is significant, he does not offer his own judgement having [26] heard both sides of the case. His function is to express the verdict of the court as a whole. When the court equivocates in deciding on the merits of the case, the case is usually heard again or appealed.

“To the Iban, the tuai rumah 's traditional role is to maintain the correct relations among longhouse members and between these and the spirit world: to ensure that the longhouse community does not become angat , literally ‘hot’, implying an unexpiated offence against the spirits ... Any offence against customary law, known or unknown, deliberate or unintentional, disturbs the relation. When the tuai rumah presides over the court of longhouse members which settles disputes and fines offenders, and he imposes the general verdict, he is restoring the community's state of spiritual harmony. The desired balance is re-established as soon as a fine has been paid by the offender and, in certain circumstances, a sacrifice offered (Richards, 1963, 2, makes the same point). If, in exceptional circumstances, the offender is not discovered and convicted, the tuai rumah may take the fine upon himself in order to restore harmony between the spirit world and men.” (Jensen, 1974, pp. 25-26)

However, the tuai rumah was not the most important religious office. The religious head of the longhouse was the 'tuai burong', whose role is described as follows:

""The most important person in everyday life is the tuai burong (see below, pp. 135, 159-63). He is a man of considerable standing in his own village and in certain cases his reputation may extend much farther afield … The tuai burong is the augur, but he is not merely an augury expert. He is, above all, favoured with the spirit attention which expresses itself regularly in omens and dreams … The tuai burong , through his dreams, his augury, and in his ritual activities, leads the community, and because he is responsible for the omen sticks (megai kayu burong) he is known as the foundation or base of the longhouse (pun rumah) … The tuai burong leads the longhouse community in most daily religious matters and especially those concerning rice cultivation."" (Jensen, 1974, p 60)

However, the distinction between the offices of tuai rumah and tuai burong was largely academic, since in the past both were 'almost invariably' held by the same individual:

""Administration of customary law and the social code as such, the adat in its restricted and technical sense, falls to the tuai rumah (see above, pp. 25 seq.). Unlike the office of tuai burong , the tuai rumah is officially recognized by the government, although the position carries no emoluments. The functions of tuai rumah and tuai burong are distinct, but in practice it is often the same man who performs both. This was the case in approximately two-thirds of the longhouses studied in the Lemanak and Delok. In the past, while the Iban remained comparatively isolated and pindah migration was a recurrent event thought to depend for its success on spirit favour and the correct response to spirit guidance, the tuai burong was almost invariably also tuai rumah. In recent years, a more settled way of life and the expectation that the tuai rumah will act as host to visiting officials and as spokesman or longhouse representative before the authorities, have come to demand qualities which the traditional tuai burong did not need nor alwavs possess."" (Jensen, 1974, p. 61)

The fact that the tuai rumah was usually also the tuai burong may explain why earlier sources (e.g. Gomes, 1909, pp. 152-219) do not mention the latter.","jensen1974[23-40, 59-64]"
17758,iban,86,2,150-2,"""No sooner had he arrived than James Brooke set about to learn something of the people living near Sarawak ... He spent two days with the 'Sebuyau Dayaks,' an Iban sub-group who lived at Stunggang on the Lundu River, west of the Sarawak River and Kuching. The Stunggang longhouse, located about eighteen miles upstream from the sea, was surrounded by a “slight stockade,” Brooke reported ... [3] ...Brooke went on to describe all the essential aspects of Iban culture, and his account makes pleasantly familiar reading for anyone who has enjoyed the hospitality of a modern Iban longhouse. He observed that the 'front room, or street' (ruai) and the open verandah (tanju) sections of the longhouse were 'the resort of pigs, dogs, birds, monkeys and fowls,' presenting 'a glorious scene of confusion and bustle.' He counted two hundred men, women and children in these portions, and concluded that the total population of the house could not be less than 400."" (Pringle, 1968, pp. 2-3)

“The basic unit of Iban social and political organization is the elementary family, superficially little different from the modern Western family, consisting of a married couple, their children, and normally some of their parents. Such a family group occupies one room (bilek) of a longhouse, and Freeman has termed it ‘the bilek family.’ … The bilek family unit holds rights to hill rice land which are established, as in many Southeast Asian societies, by felling virgin jungle. It carries on most farming operations, holds certain types of cherished heirloom property, and maintains the vitally important strain of sacred rice (padi pun) which is the focus of the padi cult. Because it is a continuing social organization with central functions in Iban life, the bilek family is what social anthropologists call a corporate group. 

“The most significant political feature of Iban society is not the bilek family, however. It is the absence of equally [35] definable institutions at any higher level. Contrary to popular impression, an Iban longhouse, far from being a communal structure, is no more than a loose aggregation of bilek families.  Each family owns not only its own bilek room, but the adjoining section of the longhouse verandah (ruai) and open drying platform (tanju) as well. One narrow passageway (tempuan) adjacent to the verandah is the only communal portion of the house, and it is exactly analogous to a village street … In pioneer areas, the Iban longhouse is anything but a stable social unit. Community quarrels often result in partition or even fragmentation, with individual families joining other houses or starting new ones … [36] … Some authorities have written of Iban ‘tribes,’ implying the existence of broader political units above the longhouse level. Usually these are said to correspond to rivers, between which, in long-settled areas, there are still marked variations in language accent, ritual practice and customary law. Freeman refers to tribes ‘such as the Skrang, the Lemanak, the Ulu Ai Dayaks etc.,’ as ‘conglomerations of kindred which formed the basis for a loose tribal organization.’ He then goes on to define an Iban tribe as ‘a diffuse territorial grouping dispersed along the banks of a major river and its diverging tributaries. Formerly it was a grouping whose members did not take one another's heads....’ But on one notable occasion in pre- [37] Brooke Iban history the population of one river split into two warring factions, with a third faction unhappily caught in the middle, following an insignificant dispute. Moreover, after the Brookes arrived, they made a common practice of enlisting downriver Ibans to fight rebellious Ibans living in the upper portions of the same river system. There is no evidence whatever that in so doing they violated any traditional concept of tribal unity. In most areas, during the period covered by this study, Iban population was shifting and mingling too frequently as the result of constant migrations to allow the development of any consistent, meaningful tribal political units … In the field of individual leadership, as in other areas of Iban life, there were few clearly defined institutions above the level of the bilek family. The longhouse headman (tuai rumah) filled a number of important functions. He served as [38] the custodian of the customary law; he was an arbitrator between the various family groups; and in recent years he has been the intermediary between his longhouse community and the Government. Aside from these roles, ‘his authority is negligible and he is in no sense a chief.’ ... The Brookes created superior headmen (penghulu), who they hoped would exert authority over many longhouses throughout whole river segments, but their performance was frequently disappointing to the Government. Iban society was indeed capable of producing powerful leaders who exercised influence over wide areas, but such ability was entirely a function of individual performance and reputation. Achievement in pioneering, oratory, and above all in warfare enabled a man to attain high political stature. To be considered a war leader, an individual had to possess not only a reputation for leadership ability, but for a necessary range of personal religious experience as well. Such a leader -- one who had dreamed the necessary dreams -- was said to be “able to attack” ( tau serang ), and once a man achieved this label he could count on a following. Nevertheless, some [39] of the most famous Iban rebels and warleaders, including Bantin, were not tau serang , indicating that this religious qualification was not a rigid requirement. The son of a famous leader enjoyed a head start toward achieving fame and influence himself, but, without the necessary personal qualities, no amount of hereditary position, much less Government support, could make him an authority.” (Pringle, 1968, pp. 34-39)",pringle1968[34-39]

“It can be said that these simple folk do not recognize any kind of govern- ment. Those who are called chiefs among them are either the bravest or the richest, and their authority is limited to a certain deference they receive from those of their own village or sometimes of nearby vil- lages -without anybody believing that for this reason they have any obligation at all to carry out their orders. I have had many occasions to test what I have just said: when there would be reason for them to receive orders from the chiefs, they could be seen screaming at them and threatening them with earth and sky, but for all this the only success [100] they would have was that nobody would pay the least attention to what they were told. As I have already indicated, they are governed by custom, and with regard to justice, each takes it into his own hands.” (Alarcon & Scott, 1965, pp. 99-100)

""I have already said that the Ifugaos have no king, nor ruler. They pay tribute to no one.

At the Rejang level:

""The Njang Serai cult serves furthermore to stabilise the traditional political system by reinforcing at each rice season the values upon which clan and lineage exogamic exclusiveness are based. We have seen that the Njang Serai field shrine ritual is conducted not only by individual  farmers - who may overlook or disregard it in some years -but most importantly by the elder of each village patrilineage (sukau), at a ceremony to which all members of the sukau are invited. In Topos such sukau rites are carried out both before the first dibble-planting and at harvest time. In the Bemanai clan, the Njang Serai ceremony takes the form of a corporate mdundang poi clan feast for the ritual remarriage and rebirth of paddy. 

""The exogamic character of the original four patriclans is repeatedly stressed during the five, seven or nine days of the mdundang poi festival. Although it is essential for all four clans to take part in it, the dancing and courtship of the youths is nevertheless strictly regulated by the exogamic principle. The festival, apart from stressing the ideal exogamic structure and relationship of the four pillar clans, emphasises their unity as an integral polito-ritual confederation within which bride-exchange occurs, blood money is paid and the rice goddess is propitiated. Whilst the Bemanai clan is both host and owner of the mdundang poi festival, it is managed by a council of the four pillar clans. It is nowadays one of the rare occasions, other than when summoned for administrative purposes by the government, when the pesirea of all four clans (and their localised subclans) meet.

At the village level the situation was different. Religious authority appears to have been shared between the pesirëa (headman), tuai kutai (village elder), and the duku'en (shaman), with the duku'en being most important:

""In every village there is at least one shaman-cum-medicine man (duku’en) who is the chief officiator at family and community ritual occasions (kedurai).

(Jaspan, 1964, p. 243)

These roles were clearly distinct:

""The native division of roles in Redjang society is described in the ketje already referred to in Chapter 1. 'The village community is constructed of four [kinds of] people: radja, imam, shaman, craftsman.'  … Each of these four spheres was regarded as complimentary and equally important. The 'specialists' in each sphere might command respect and authority within the boundaries of their roles but had themselves to accord respect and authority to the specialists who filled other roles. Thus the headman enjoyed no special position or authority in the mosque or in divination ritual; nor did the shaman enjoy any authority in the mosque or in village administration. This division of roles - they are hardly skills, as most men could if necessary perform any of them - resulted in a rather egalitarian interdependence of many men each vested with a share of delegated authority."" (Jaspan, 1964, p. 214)

The situation at the clan and subclan levels may have been similar:

""In the past, as in the case of a village, each subclan had two shamans, one to counter the devils of the sea (duku'en lau'eut) and the other to counter the land devils (duku'en da'eut)."" (Jaspan, 1964, p. 143)

""The constitution of the confederation is unwritten but recounted in a number of ketje. By comparing and analysing the archaic metaphors of these ketje it becomes evident that the Four Pillars were equally represented at a Long Council House (Baleui Panjang) where the adjai, clan shamans (duku'en mergo), village headmen (ginde) and patrilineage elders (tuai-tuai dju’eui or sukau) assembled as occasion demanded to resolve difficult or long-standing conflicts and to conciliate the opposing parties."" (Jaspan, 1964, p. 31)

The largest-scale Rejang ceremonies were in the hands of one particular clan, which clearly did not enjoy political supremacy:

""In order to establish a more effective system of conciliation and adjudication of disputes, the Four Pillars are said to have sent a courier to the Radjo Alam ruler of the Minangkabau kingdom at Pagar Rujung, with a request that she send a deputy who could be their supreme judge and ensure peace among the four clans. The Redjang of Lais, and especially the Semitoa non-pillar clan at Sungei Lemeuw a few kilometres to the north of Bencoolen, claim that the deputy sent from Pagar Rujung was Sri Maharadja Sakti who landed at Sungei Lemeuw and established a court at Balai Buntar nearby. According to his descendants, who still bear the title of radjo, Sri Maharadja Sakti's pre-eminence was recognised by the Four Pillars, and henceforth the Redjang polity was referred to as 'Four Redjang Pillars, Five with the  Radja' (Djang Tiang Pat, lemo ngen radjo). This claim is not conceded by the main body of Redjang in the Highlands. The Redjang of the Upper Musi recognised no overlord, whilst those in Lebong admitted only a nominal jural supremacy to the pesirda of the Sukau IX moiety of the Tubeui bang mego. The pesirfe'as of Sukau IX claim descent in a direct line from Bundo Kandung, Queen of the Alam Minangkabau realm (see Pedigree 2).

""It is doubtful whether the pesirga of Sukau IX ever enjoyed any real authority over the Four Pillars. The institution of radjo appears to have been at attempt by Minangkabau rantau emigrants to establish a hegemony over Redjang society in the manner of their overlordship of other societies in Central Sumatra and Djambi, In this the northernmost Redjang seem to have acquiesced nominally but the essential features of the egalitarian Four Pillar system continued unchanged. The Minangkabau immigrants, on the contrary, were gradually assimilated into Redjang society, their matrilineal institutions being replaced by the Redjang rule of patrilineal descent."" (Jaspan, 1964, p. 48)

""The Njang Serai cult serves furthermore to stabilise the traditional political system by reinforcing at each rice season the values upon which clan and lineage exogamic exclusiveness are based. We have seen that the Njang Serai field shrine ritual is conducted not only by individual  farmers - who may overlook or disregard it in some years -but most importantly by the elder of each village patrilineage (sukau), at a ceremony to which all members of the sukau are invited. In Topos such sukau rites are carried out both before the first dibble-planting and at harvest time. In the Bemanai clan, the Njang Serai ceremony takes the form of a corporate mdundang poi clan feast for the ritual remarriage and rebirth of paddy. 

""The exogamic character of the original four patriclans is repeatedly stressed during the five, seven or nine days of the mdundang poi festival. Although it is essential for all four clans to take part in it, the dancing and courtship of the youths is nevertheless strictly regulated by the exogamic principle. The festival, apart from stressing the ideal exogamic structure and relationship of the four pillar clans, emphasises their unity as an integral polito-ritual confederation within which bride-exchange occurs, blood money is paid and the rice goddess is propitiated. Whilst the Bemanai clan is both host and owner of the mdundang poi festival, it is managed by a council of the four pillar clans. It is nowadays one of the rare occasions, other than when summoned for administrative purposes by the government, when the pesirea of all four clans (and their localised subclans) meet.

Secular authority seems clearly based in the male age-grade system, with women expressly excluded from age-graders and men's houses (the educational and administrative centers of the village) and thus from political life. At the same time, it seems evident that ritual authority has its basis in the female-oriented matrilineage system, although here again it is the brothers of lineage women who actually function as priests. In retrospect, the age-grade system has the appearance of having been superimposed on an original kin-based society, with positions of leadership grounded in (largely) ritual status derived from the genealogical nearness to an original 'founding' line. The result has been a kind of split between secular and ritual leadership ... According to C. L. Chen (1965), political power in northern ... Ami villages is vested in a 'chiefs assembly', composed of men chosen from among the papuro'ai (lit.: 'one who speaks""), leaders or monitors of the mature age-grades. A man who seeks this office must be an eloquent speaker, skilled in ritual and hunting, and wealthy enough to sponsor a feast and display his wealth before all other papaur'ai. A speaker, elected by the chiefs' assembly is the 'high chief' in the village, although hunting, warfare and headhunting are the responsibility of another high chief , who is elected from among the warrior chiefs of the various age-grades. Other assemblies or councils (of elders, of all males, of all age-grade monitors) mitigate to some extent the power of the chief's assembly. A somewhat similar system of secular 'chiefs' (saparangau), leaders of proven ability chosen from the ranks of the more mature age-grades, is described by Chen and Coe (1954) for the central Ami village of Tavarong. Political power here is in the hands of these older men, who are seated at important ceremonies in order of their rank (Furuno 1945:285ff.) ... The situation in the central Ami village of Vataan, most fully described of all Ami villages, is apparently somewhat atypical. Here the village (niaroh) is divided into hamlets or sections (kuan), each with a headman and a representative (kakisowal, 'eloquent speaker'). From among the kakisowal are elected the members (komod) of a village council, administrators of fishing and hunting rights and other village-owned property. From among the council membership, in turn, there is chosen a 'high chief' (sapalungau), a genealogical/ritual specialist who sets the dates for major festivals and presides over meetings and ceremonies ... As summarized by by Liu et al. (1965:169-88, 265-167), leadership in Vataan is in the hands of a high chief, assisted by hamlet headmen and age-class leaders, with the high chief acting additionally in the capacity of a chief priest. This kind of political hierarchy, with its by-passing of the traditional rights of the kakitaan priestly families, has progessed farthest in Vataan - probably as a consequence of Taiwanese acculutrative pressures.""

""By comparison, Berawan society is small in scale, relatively egalitarian, and composed of just four autonomous ritual and political units - the separate longhouse communities.""(Huntington & Metcalf, 1979, pp 133-134)

‘Prestigious men’ appear to have served as the main political and religiousl leaders (they directed mortuary rites, nulang, described as the ‘central’ component of Berawan religion). There appears to have been only one ‘outstandingly prestigious’ man in each community. However, this does not appear to have been an office in the sense of ‘a standardized group of duties and privileges devolving upon a person in certain defined situations’ (Hughes, 1937). Rather than the right to organise a nulang being vested in the role of ‘prestigious man’, organising nulang led to recognition as a prestigious man. 

""In each longhouse, one family apartment is designated as that of the chiefly family, the former residence of the last outstandingly prestigious man of the community."" (Huntington & Metcalf, 1979, p 133)

""There are many reasons, ideological, symbolic and social, why mortuary rites are central to Berawan religion and society. But it is not hard to see why they are utilized by leaders in order to make a statement about their own positions. Weddings and other rites of passage also provide an opportunity for community cooperation and conspicuous consumption. The Kenyah, close neighbours of the Berawan, employ name-giving ceremonies as their most important ritual of prestige. But the Kenyah have a more rigid system of prescribed rank than the Berawan, including endogamous class strata. For them it is possible to specify the status of a child in a way that is not for the Berawan ... the Berawan have no naming ceremonies comparable to Kenyah ones. They do appreciate the status implications of grand weddings. But when all the rice wine has been drunk, and the guests have shakily made their way home, what is there to keep a wedding in mind, to preserve it against the envious denigrations of rivals? The Berawan require something more concrete, and it is mortuary rites that provide it. Mausoleums are always built on the riverbank so that passersby can admire them and wonder at the power of their architects.

""At the outset, we noted that only people of high rank can command the support required to conduct a nulang or build a mausoleum. But we found it hard to define what rank is. We can now offer that definition by turning the original statement on its head. Berawan rank is, in part, the product of personal abilities: That person who can fuse the community together in coordinated action, that person is an aristocrat.""

Orang kaya as officiant:

""At their feasts on less war-like occasions, their more powerful and good spirits are petitioned by prayer and supplication to be present; but as these festivals are intimately connected with their religious observances, I will in this place describe one which was made on my arrival at the village of the Sebongoh Hill Dyaks, in August, 1845, in honour of the first European visit to them. After having consented to remain while the chief collected the tribe, I sat down in the verandah of the house, which had been prepared for my reception by being covered with fine white Sirhassan mats : similar ones were also strewed from my boat to the houses, which are built on the banks of the river, so that I might not soil my feet in the ascent to them. Soon after I was seated, the Orang Kaya (chief of a village) requested me to give them a little piece of doth, and a small silver coin — they wishing to cut off the string of a pillow- [255] case for the first, but I gave them a grass-cloth hand- kerchief, which very much delighted them : the old chief brought out his wife to receive it, and the lady told me that it was to be hung up in the house as a memorial of my visit, and to preserve the village from evil influence.

""When the feast was about to begin— or rather the preparations for it — I was desired by the Orang Kaya to accompany him to the stage before the verandah, which is used by the Dyaks for dryiug their Padi (Indian-corn), Jagong (maize), &c. Having determined, for the purpose of seeing the ceremony, to be quite passive in their hands, I accordingly rose, and went with him. The old man held in his left hand a small saucer, filled with rice, which had been made yellow by a mixture with Kunyit, or Turmeric, and other herbs. He then uttered a prayer in Malay, which he had previously requested me to repeat after him. It was addressed to Tuppa, the sun and moon, and the Rajah of Sarawak, to request that the next Padi harvest might be abundant, that their families might be increased with male children, and that their pigs and fowls might be very prolific: it was, in fact, a prayer for general prosperity to the country and tribe."" (Low, 1848, pp. 254-255)

Alleged lack of religious specialists:

""The Land Dyaks have not among their tribes any of the peculiar functionaries described as ‘Manangs’ in the preceding chapters … The only person who appears amongst them to be professionally connected with their religious observances, is the ‘Balean,’ who prepares the piles for the burning of their dead, as these Dyaks do not dispose of their dead relations by burial."" (Low, 1848, p. 262)

'Priests' and 'priestesses':

""The priests must in many respects be regarded as impostors, though, of course, even with their deceitful practices is mixed much superstitious credulity. They pretend to meet and to converse with spirits, to receive warnings, and sometimes presents from them, to have the power of seeing and capturing the departed soul of a sick man, and to be able to find and secure for the Dayaks that vital principle of the rice which 'Tapa' sends down from above at their two chief harvest feasts ... For getting back a man's soul he receives six gallons of uncleaned rice; for extracting a spirit from a man’s body, the same fee, and for getting the soul of the rice at harvest feasts he receives three cups from every family in whose apartment he obtains it. The value of six gallons of uncleaned rice is not very great, but it is the sixtieth part of the amount obtained by an able-bodied man for his annual farm labour.

""The priestesses have their fees, but they do not make so much from the superstition of their country-men as the male professors."" (St. John, 1862, pp 201-202)

Priests, priestesses and manangs:

""It was generally believed that much of the serious sickness was caused by evil demons, who either wounded the patient internally, stayed in his body to work harm, or stole one of his seven souls which, combined, sustain his life ... Treatment could be had from three different classes of practitioner. The priests of the ancestral cult simply made offerings to the ancestors and to the demons, appealing to the demons to stop troubling the patient and to the ancestors to use their influence in seeing that they did. The priestesses of the women's cult appealed in the same way to their own set of deities and to the demons, but went one stage further in actually catching the patient's lost soul, usually in the form of a small stone snatched out of the air, and returning it to him. Finally, there were in Mentu Tapuh two persons termed manangs.

""The performances of the manangs were much more livelyy, making up in melodrama for their poorer sanction in tradition. These two practitioners diagnosed, prognosed, invoked deities, danced in semi-trance consulting their deities in person, derived power from special objects in their possession, demonstrated superhuman qualities, and caught souls. But the most important way in which they differed in their practice from the others was that they actually treated the patient, either by sucking or pulling the sickness out of him, or by using mysterious medicines, or both ... The leading manang - or spirit-medium, or shaman , or medicine-man, or witch-doctor, for he was all of these - was a man of about twenty-eight years old named Raseh.""

'Religion and society' (Fox, 1982, pp. 145-247)

Political authority:

""Tagbanua society is stratified, class positions being determined by bilateral filiation. There are only two classes at present; the ‘high blood’ called ginu?u in Baraki or bagerar [124] in Apis, and the ‘low bloods,’ the dulu?an or timawa ... The members of the ‘high bloods’ are actually the bilateral descendants of ginu?u, that is, hereditary leaders who act either as the judges during the councils or who defend the litigants ... Limited by the above tendencies which influence succession, titles pass to the male relatives who have shown the greatest interest in and knowledge of jural procedures. Men who are eligible for a title and interested in law participate continually in the surugidin or councils, learning all the nuances of argumentation and decision making."" (Fox, 1982, pp 123-124)

""The decisions reached in these informal councils normally represent a consensus of the opinions of the ginu?u present; decisions which have been obtained by numerous agreements. Then an older or ranking hereditary leader acting as the ‘judge’ formulates the decision."" (Fox, 1982, p 128)

""The highest jural and political office among the Tagbanuwa is the masikampu, as I have indicated. Regardless of the Spanish origin of this term [130] and the fact that the Spaniards had no intense contacts with the Tagbanuwa until about 1872, the folk history of the Tagbanuwa indicates that the functions of this office are at least one hundred and fifty years old and probably older. Limas, who was only the seventh masikampu, ruled sometime between 1870 and 1890. According to Clemente Bulunan, the first masikampu was appointed by the Surutan (‘sultan’) of Brunei, Borneo … However, Arngaw, the twelfth masikampu … said that the first masikampu was appointed by Surutan Rum of ?ulu (Jolo) … Both of the legendary genealogies are plausible, for the Sultans of Jolo (Sulu) once included Brunei, North Borneo, but I tend to place greater weight on Clemente’s opinions."" (Fox, 1982, pp 128-130)

""All informants agree that the minor titles held by the Tagbanuwa ginu?u were given to them by the Suluk. These were probably the Taosug, the Moros of Jolo Island ... The entire Taosug group were united in the Sultanate of Sulu, and brought under their domination large parts of Borneo and Palawan. My genealogies also show numerous recent instances in which Tagbanuwa men were given titles by Moro ambassadors of a Sultan or Datu. My genealogies also show numerous recent instances in which Tagbanuwa men were given titles by Moro ambassadors of a Sultan or Datu ... It is said that these Moro ambassadors and traders carried brass 'guns' ... The Moro ambassador placed one of these guns on the shoulder of the Tagbanuwa appointee and fired it. At the same time the ambassador announced the appointment and recited a formula: 'May your stomach burst like this gun, if you fail in the performance of your duties.' This custom was adopted and continued by the masikampu who subsequently appointed most of the minor hereditary [131] leaders ... The customary residence of the line of masikampu has been the village of Ingawan but due to the great social and cultural change there the present masikampu moved to the more conservative village of Baraki."" (Fox, 1982, pp 130-131)

""One or more hereditary leaders of lesser rank are also found in each Tagbanuwa community. As Venturello notes, they ‘hear in the first instances the cases of little moment which occur within their jurisdiction’ ... [133] ... These numerous titles do not form any hierarchy, despite Venturello’s statements (p. 519), rather each is an autonomous office. However, four titles, Maradya, Saribangsawan, Nakib, and Sabandar, are often thought of as being slightly higher than the others ... The power of a title, except that of the masikampu, resides generally in the popularity and capability of the individual who holds it regardless of whether he is a Nakib or a Pangarapan. It is for this reason that there is no real civil hierarchy below the masikampu. Unfavourable decisions by minor leaders may be appealed to the Masikampu usually though a hereditary leader other than the one who rendered the decision. In former days, as Venturello notes, the decisions of the masikampu were final."" (Fox, 1982, pp 132-133)

Religious authority:

According to Fox there were five 'socio-religious' units among the Tagbanuwa: the individual, the nuclear family, the bilateral family, the village, and the Tagbanuwa as a whole:

""Looked at in another way, each individual Tagbanuwa is involved in varying degrees in five socio-religious systems. Each of these social units has by and large its own ritual behavior and obligations ... The five expanding units of coordinate religious and social activities which will form the working basis for the analysis of religion among the Tagbanua are as follows:

""(1) The individual as a 'social personality' who plays various roles in which ritual practices and social activities are interwoven ... [147] (2) The elementary family of the father, mother and children, the basic social unit of Tagbanuwa society, is linked religiously with the cult of the dead ... (3) The bilateral family and bilateral kindred are correlated with the complex diwata ceremony in which the babaylan is the principal functionary ... (4) The village or community is defined, in part, by its religious unity. Ceremonies such as the lambay formally embrace all of the inhabitants of a village. The members of the community are required by legal sanctions to participate in these village ceremonies.

""(5) Finally, there are pan-Tagbanwa ceremonies, such as the runsay, which are structured with a vague but growing concept of a Tagbanuwa 'nation'."" (Fox, 1982, pp 146-147). 

There appears to have been no religious authority at the nuclear family level, since anyone could perform the bilang ceremony. However, the pagdiwata ceremonies that were performed on behalf of the bilateral family required a babalyan. Babaylan do not appear to have held any formal political power, but like political leaders they belonged to the upper class:

""The babalyan have numerous duties and exert a considerable influence upon the everyday social activities of the people. They select ritually favorable clearings, placate environmental deities, interpret dreams, provide charms for hunting and fishing, and treat all types of serious illness. During the familial bilang ceremonies any adult can invoke the spirits of the dead. But the many deities which appear during the pagdiwata rituals can only be called by the babalyan. They are trained intermediaries who guide the interaction of the living with the deities as well as with the dead.

""A varying number of babalyan are found in each village and the majority are women, of the villages surveyed twenty of the thirty-one practicing babalyan were women. However, the higher religious functionaries are men, such as the katungkulan and the maglambay for these positions are identified with political and juridical roles."" (Fox, 1982, p 207). 

""With few exceptions, if any, the babalyan are 'high bloods,' reinforcing the political and juridical privileges of the ginu?u class. There is a correlation between ritual and juridicial leadership. Thus the 'low bloods' are in a disadvantageous position ritually, as well as politically."" (Fox, 1982, p. 209).

At the village level, the lambay ceremony was performed by the maglambay, who had the power to force villagers to participate in the ceremony, as well as enforcing laws against incest:

“Reflecting the twofold climatic needs of shifting-cultivation of dry rice and the unpredictability of the monthly rainfall in central Palawan ... the lambay ritual is held twice annually. The first lambay in January is an appeal in part for sunny days and dry winds which will dessicate the forests and faciliate the preparation of rice-clearings. The second one in May is for the moderate rains so necessary in the growth of the upland rice.  These two rituals are also petitions to the highest-ranking deity by the leader of the ceremony, the maglambay, that he forgive the people for acts of incest which they have committed ... The maglambay of Baraki is Nakib Dunglad. He succeeded his famous father, Dangus. Insofar as I know, all of the maglambay have been hereditary leaders for these are village rituals which demand the participation of every family. Dunglad exercises specified sanctions to enforce participation, a combined ritual and juridicial role. The fines for incest are paid to the maglambay. He is responsible to the highest ranking deity for these infamous acts, whether known to him or not, and he must defend his wards ... If the maglambay does not fulful the duties of his office properly, Magindusa might cause his death."" (Fox, 1982, p. 229)

There were two 'Pan-Tagbanuwa' ceremonies: pagbuy?is and runsay. The pagbuy?is was led by a figure called the mabuy?is:

""The Pagbuy?is. Abala, the mabuy?is in Baraki, performs this ritual three times a year ... [239] ... Abala succeeded his grandfather, Kamat, as a mabuy?is ... The salakap sail during the northeast winds in a huge boat, the sakayan, and bring smallpox, cholera, dysentery, flu and other epidemic sickness. They gather the souls of those who die and carry them back to kiyabusan, the 'end of the world' ... Abala calls these deities during the pagbuy?is to 'convince' them that they should not 'catch' the souls of the Tagbanuwa. The ritual offerings are said to placate them and to win their favour."" (Fox, 1982, pp. 238-239)

""A sizeable crowd was present, amazingly large in view of the fact that there would be no social drinking. The participants were mostly relatives of Abala and his wife and individuals whom they were both treating. However, this ritual is for all Tagbanuwa regardless of their kinship or residence. Abala considers himself a 'priest' and as responsible for protecting all the Tagbanuwa in Palawan against the salakap."" (Fox, 1982, p. 242)

The runsay was similar to the pagbuy?is. A footnote implies that the leader of this ceremony was also called magbuy?is:

""The Runsay. In many ways this is the most dramatic of the many Tagbanuwa rituals. It is held at night once a year - the fourth day after the full moon of December - on the beach near the mouth of the Arborlan River. The purpose of this ritual is identical to that of the pagbuy?is, that is, to protect all Tagbanuwa from the spirits of epidemic sicknesss.

""In 1950 the runsay fell on the twenty-fifth of December. The leader of the ceremony was Landag, a resident of Iraan. This was his twentieth performance."" (Fox, 1982, p. 242)

Footnote 51 to p. 242:

""According to Landag, the first leader or mabuy?is or [sic] runsay was Tagam. He was followed by Unas, Tanas, Lingdas, Ribras and Laksamana Dungul. Landag succeeded Dungul who was an older cousin of Landag's father."" 

There is no indication that the office mabuy?is involved political power, but presumably these figures, like the babalyan, belonged to the upper class.","fox1982[123-139, 145-247]"

Most important religious leader was the tamon alúsuia – his authority appears to have been islandwide:

""The association of religion and medicine is found not only in the healing of individuals, but also in the group or public ceremonies and rituals. All public ceremonies are medicine ceremonies, in which medicine is prepared and consumed, as a prophylactic against future illness, and in which the alúsemar are invoked to protect the people from illness. Though many alús are involved, it is Tilitr that plays the important role in these ceremonies. Tilitr lives in Fatuma with the pantheon of high gods, but descends to Ifaluk frequently, particularly when he is invoked at the public ceremonies, and then returns to Aluelap to report to him. Tilitr, as has already been indicated, is the patron saint of Ifaluk, protecting the people from evil and from illness."" (Burrows & Spiro, 1953, p 227)

""Having neither calendars nor other formal methods of reckoning time, religious ceremonies are not held at regularly defined intervals, but are called by the chiefs at the suggestion of Arogeligar, when he feels the time is propitious."" (Burrows & Spiro, 1953, p 228)

""The person who has figured so prominently in these ceremonies is Arogeligar. He is the tamon alúsuia, literally, ‘the leader for (matters concerning) the alús’. The tamon alúsuia is the religio-medical specialist, but like the other specialists he devotes only part of his time to his specialty, since he assumes the same economic responsibilities as the other men. The office of tamon alúsuia is inherited patrilineally, it being passed on from the incumbent to any male relative in his patrilineal line … But descent is not a sufficient qualification for this office; a successor in a state of possession must be designated by Tilitr for the office. The incumbent appoints a male relative as his successor upon the latter's request, and instructs him in the lore and knowledge of the position. At the death of the tamon, his designated successor seeks possession or a vision … Unlike the other people who are possessed only by the alús of their lineage, Arogeligar is possessed only by Tilitr and by Tilikong, an alús who does the bidding of Tilitr … It is apparent that though the possession and induction into the office of tamon alúsuia involves a personal, psychological experience, it is one that is [Page 243] completely culturally patterned. Only certain individuals can inherit the office and since they prepare for it by formal training and by psychological conditioning, it is not strange that the sought-for vision should materialize."" (Burrows & Spiro, 1953, pp 242-243)

Ifaluk was a very small island and every adult seems to have known each other personally. However, it was divided into territorial units – two islands, each of which were divided into two districts:

""Discussion of the pattern of relationships among the people of Ifaluk may well begin with a list of the bonds that unite the whole population. This unit has all the characteristics ordinarily cited to define a society, community or tribe. In fact, few of the aggregations called by those names are held together by as many bonds as the people of Ifaluk. They share, to begin with, a common habitat and a common culture. Being so few, and confined within so little space, they are all personally acquainted by the time they grow up; though of course the degree of acquaintanceship varies widely. (Burrows & Spiro, 1953, p 121)

""The largest territorial subdivisions of the population are determined by residence on one or the other of the two inhabited islands, Falārik and Falālap. Although some individuals have ties on both islands, and shift their residence rather freely from one to the other, nearly everyone is clearly identified, for participation in communal activities, with one or the other … Each of the islands is further divided into two districts (gapilām). On Falārik island these are Falārik district, to the north households 1–8 inclusive), and Rauau (households 9–19). On Falālap they are Ievang, to the north (the name means ‘north’—households 20–24) and Iauru (‘south’ households 25–29)."" (Burrows & Spiro, 1953, p. 123)",burrows-spiro1953[207-343]

'The mediums' (Cole & Gale, 1922, pp. 301-304)

The only religious specialist mentioned is the 'medium (alopogan). While mediums as a group do not appear to have been hierarchically organised, the role of medium was clearly an 'office'. Mediums needed to go through a kind of 'accreditation' process in order to practice:

""The Mediums. — The superior beings talk with mortals through the aid of mediums, known individually and collectively as alopogan ('she who covers her face'). These are generally women past middle life, though men are not barred from the profession, who, when [302] chosen, are made aware of the fact by having trembling fits when they are not cold, by warnings in dreams, or by being informed by other mediums that they are desired by the spirits. A woman may live the greater part of her life without any idea of becoming a medium, and then because of such a notification will undertake to qualify. She goes to one already versed, and from her learns the details of the various ceremonies, the gifts suitable for each spirit, and the chants or diams which must be used at certain times. This is a considerable task, for the dtams must be learned word for word; and, likewise, each ceremony must be conducted, just as it was taught by the spirits to the 'people of the first times.' The training occupies several months; and when all is ready, the candidate secures her piling. This is a collection of large sea-shells attached to cords, which is kept in a small basket together with a Chinese plate and a hundred fathoms of thread (Plate XIX). New shells may be used, but it is preferable to secure, if possible, the piling of a dead medium. Being thus supplied, the novice seeks the approval of the spirits and acceptance as a medium. The wishes of the higher beings are learned by means of a ceremony, in the course of which a pig is killed, and its blood mixed with rice is scattered on the ground. The liver of the animal is eagerly examined ; for, if certain marks appear on it, the candidate is rejected, or must continue her period of probation for several months, before another trial can be made. During this time she may aid in ceremonies, but she is not possessed by the spirits. When finally accepted, she may begin to summon the spirits into her body ... Certain mediums are visited only by low, mean spirits; others, by both good and bad; while still others may be possessed even by Kadaklan, the greatest of all ... The pay of a medium is small, usually a portion of a sacrificed animal, a few bundles of rice, and some beads; but this payment is more than offset by the restrictions placed on her ... [303] ... The inducements for a person to enter this vocation are so few that a candidate begins her training with reluctance ; but, once accepted by the spirits, the medium yields herself fully and sincerely to their wishes.” (Cole & Gale, 1922, pp. 301-303)

‘The ceremonies’ (Cole & Gale, 1922, pp, 315-358)

Most if not all ceremonies appear to have required the participation of mediums. The largest scale ceremonies described were village-level affairs. The village headman (lakay) played a leading role in scheduling and organising at least one of these ceremonies, but he does not appear to have played an active role in the ceremony itself. 

“SAGOBAY ... When an epidemic appears in a nearby settlement, the lakay summons the old men in council, and they decide on the number of pigs, and the amount of rice, basi, and other articles required, after which the necessary funds are secured by levying a tax on all the people of the village
 
“To keep the evil spirits, who bear the sickness, out of the town, a cord of bamboo or rattan is stretched around the whole settlement, while at the gate a high fence is erected. Through the uprights of this fence are stuck bamboo spikes with the sharpened ends facing [325] outward, so as to catch or pierce the intruders (Plate XXVIII) ; while in the saloko and along the gateway are placed leaves, roots, and other offerings acceptable to the friendly spirits. Similar cords and leaves are also strung around the entrances to the houses.

""The cord and gateway form an adequate protection, and no human being or spirit will violate this taboo. Should a human do so, the least penalty would be a tax sufficient to pay all the expense of the ceremony; but should the sickness afterwards invade the town, it is quite possible that more serious punishment might be exacted by the families of the victims.
When all is prepared, the men and boys arm themselves, and with shouts and hostile demonstrations drive the sickness toward the town whence it is thought to come. Returning to the center of the village, the people dance tadek, and the mediums may summon several spirits.” (Cole & Gale, 1922, pp. 324-325)

Other village-level ceremonies:

""PINAING or PINADING ... — At the gate or entrance of nearly every village will be found a number of peculiarly shaped, water-worn stones, either beneath a small shelter, or nestling among the roots of some great tree. These are the 'guardian stones,' and in them lives Apdel ('the spirit who guards the town'). Many stories cluster about these pinaing, but all agree that, if proper offerings are made to them at the beginning of a great ceremony; when the men are about to undertake a raid; or, when sickness is in a nearby village, the resident spirit will protect the people under his care. Thus it happens that several times each year a group of people may be seen early in the morning, gathered at the stones. They anoint the head of each one with oil, put new bark bands on their 'necks,' after which they kill a small pig. The medium mixes the blood of the slain animal with rice, and scatters it on the ground while she recites the story of their origin. Then she bids the spirits from near and far to come and eat, and to be kindly disposed.

""In Bakaok and some other villages it is customary for the medium to summon several spirits at this time, and this is followed by the dancing of tadek. The people of Luluno always hold a ceremony at the pinaing before the planting of the rice and after the harvest."" (Cole & Gale, 1922, p. 319)

“The culmination of these rites is the great Sayang ceremony which extends over seventeen days and nights … The supreme event can only be celebrated by a few families, but all the townpeople are welcome guests, and all, regardless of age or sex, may witness or take part in the proceedings.” (Cole & Gale, 1922, p 327).",cole-gale1922[295-358]

The island was politically unified:

""Discussion of the pattern of relationships among the people of Ifaluk may well begin with a list of the bonds that unite the whole population. This unit has all the characteristics ordinarily cited to define a society, community or tribe. In fact, few of the aggregations called by those names are held together by as many bonds as the people of Ifaluk. They share, to begin with, a common habitat and a common culture. Being so few, and confined within so little space, they are all personally acquainted by the time they grow up; though of course the degree of acquaintanceship varies widely."" (Burrows & Spiro, 1953, p 131)

“In Ifaluk, matters of public concern, except for most of the religious ones, are administered by five chiefs, who hold office by virtue of hereditary rank. So government in Ifaluk might be defined as interaction between chiefs and populace, or between chiefs and commoners. It is unmistakably institutionalized, in any sense of the protean word ‘institution.’” (Burrows & Spiro, 1953, p 177)

“The government of the tribe rests in the hands of the superior chief, or masicampo, and the nobles who constitute a Supreme Court. Each rancheria, however, is governed by its chief, or panlima, who together with the men of authority of the rancheria hear in the first instance the cases of little moment which occur within their jurisdiction. The decision of the chief is usually respected; although there [520] have been cases in which the Htigants, not satisfied with the sen- tence pronounced by their chief, appealed to the supreme tribunal at which presides the masicampo and from which there is no appeal. This chief and the nobles possess certain life privileges. They are not ostentatious and do not have the manner of the wise and high dignitaries of the Moros, whom it is not possible to approach and to whom it is not allowed to speak without kneeling, bowing the head, and kissing the feet scarcely daring to face the interlocutor. On the contrary the masicampo, when he has to decide a question, speaks gently to the defendant and complainant, commands them to be seated before him and the nobles who compose the court, listens attentively to the complaints of each one and after due consideration of the question, pronounces sentence in conformity with the nobles, the old men, and the plebeian class who are present. The litigants receive the judgment with great humility and mildness worthy of their character.” (Venturello, 1907, pp. 519-520)

‘Social class and political structures’: Fox (1982, pp. 123-139)

""Tagbanua society is stratified, class positions being determined by bilateral filiation. There are only two classes at present; the ‘high blood’ called ginu?u in Baraki or bagerar [124] in Apis, and the ‘low bloods,’ the dulu?an or timawa ... The members of the ‘high bloods’ are actually the bilateral descendants of ginu?u, that is, hereditary leaders who act either as the judges during the councils or who defend the litigants ... Limited by the above tendencies which influence succession, titles pass to the male relatives who have shown the greatest interest in and knowledge of jural procedures. Men who are eligible for a title and interested in law participate continually in the surugidin or councils, learning all the nuances of argumentation and decision making."" (Fox, 1982, pp 123-124)

""The decisions reached in these informal councils normally represent a consensus of the opinions of the ginu?u present; decisions which have been obtained by numerous agreements. Then an older or ranking hereditary leader acting as the ‘judge’ formulates the decision."" (Fox, 1982, p 128)

""The highest jural and political office among the Tagbanuwa is the masikampu, as I have indicated. Regardless of the Spanish origin of this term [130] and the fact that the Spaniards had no intense contacts with the Tagbanuwa until about 1872, the folk history of the Tagbanuwa indicates that the functions of this office are at least one hundred and fifty years old and probably older. Limas, who was only the seventh masikampu, ruled sometime between 1870 and 1890. According to Clemente Bulunan, the first masikampu was appointed by the Surutan (‘sultan’) of Brunei, Borneo … However, Arngaw, the twelfth masikampu … said that the first masikampu was appointed by Surutan Rum of ?ulu (Jolo) … Both of the legendary genealogies are plausible, for the Sultans of Jolo (Sulu) once included Brunei, North Borneo, but I tend to place greater weight on Clemente’s opinions."" (Fox, 1982, pp 128-130)

""All informants agree that the minor titles held by the Tagbanuwa ginu?u were given to them by the Suluk. These were probably the Taosug, the Moros of Jolo Island ... The entire Taosug group were united in the Sultanate of Sulu, and brought under their domination large parts of Borneo and Palawan. My genealogies also show numerous recent instances in which Tagbanuwa men were given titles by Moro ambassadors of a Sultan or Datu. My genealogies also show numerous recent instances in which Tagbanuwa men were given titles by Moro ambassadors of a Sultan or Datu ... It is said that these Moro ambassadors and traders carried brass 'guns' ... The Moro ambassador placed one of these guns on the shoulder of the Tagbanuwa appointee and fired it. At the same time the ambassador announced the appointment and recited a formula: 'May your stomach burst like this gun, if you fail in the performance of your duties.' This custom was adopted and continued by the masikampu who subsequently appointed most of the minor hereditary [131] leaders ... The customary residence of the line of masikampu has been the village of Ingawan but due to the great social and cultural change there the present masikampu moved to the more conservative village of Baraki."" (Fox, 1982, pp 130-131)

""One or more hereditary leaders of lesser rank are also found in each Tagbanuwa community. As Venturello notes, they ‘hear in the first instances the cases of little moment which occur within their jurisdiction’ ... [133] ... These numerous titles do not form any hierarchy, despite Venturello’s statements (p. 519), rather each is an autonomous office. However, four titles, Maradya, Saribangsawan, Nakib, and Sabandar, are often thought of as being slightly higher than the others ... The power of a title, except that of the masikampu, resides generally in the popularity and capability of the individual who holds it regardless of whether he is a Nakib or a Pangarapan. It is for this reason that there is no real civil hierarchy below the masikampu. Unfavourable decisions by minor leaders may be appealed to the Masikampu usually though a hereditary leader other than the one who rendered the decision. In former days, as Venturello notes, the decisions of the masikampu were final."" (Fox, 1982, pp 132-133)",venturello-1907;fox1982[123-129]

""Longhouse communities coalesce around one leading hearth-group focused on a couple who are fully lun merar … As has been discussed, there is an equivalence, at a [204] higher level, of the position of lun merar of a hearthgroup and lun merar of the community; at the latter level, the term lun merar was, in the past, the only term for leader. Just as the lun merar of the hearth-group are a couple, so it was the focal couple of the leading hearthgroup who were the de facto leaders of the community in terms of internal matters, although the appointment of a man as ketua kampong nowadays by the government has obscured this ... Men speak, and spoke in the past, more than women at formal meetings, but women speak as much as men at informal gatherings at which attitudes, facts and decisions are thrashed out. Formal meetings are formal statements of the situation, and forums at which consequences, decisions and punishments are finalised and made public. Although, where the lun merar of a hearthgroup are a couple, the man will speak at formal meetings, a woman will speak if her husband is dead ... Leadership of a longhouse or multi-longhouse [205] community should be in the hands of one leading hearthgroup, whose lun merar, the lun merar of the whole community, are definitely lun doo and preferably, for the prestige of the whole community in inter-community affairs, lun doo to'o. Such leadership is, on an everyday level, in the hands of both the man and the woman of this couple. The strength of character, charisma, ability to express themselves and decisiveness which they should have should enable them to lead the community in rice-growing decisions, which are the major cooperative decisions that need to be made within the community. These same qualities tend to cause people to come round to their way of thinking in the informal discussions which precede a formal meeting held to resolve a conflict within the community. Both the man and the woman will, in these contexts, persuade others to take their point of view, and at the formal meeting this will be very likely to prevail. For the sake of their credibility and prestige, it is important that the leading couple should not be seen to have varying opinions but to be in agreement substantially with each other.

""In Pa' Dalih when I was there there was no hearthgroup seen as fully qualified to lead; despite the presence of a ketua kampong, leadership appeared to be effectively shared out among a number of hearth-groups, none of whom had complete authority. The reason for this situation was probably that the hearth-groups at least some of whose members were considered to have inherited the greatest potential to be doo to'o could not provide a fully viable lun merar couple. (203-205)
While the leadership of the community is in the hands of a couple, leadership of the community in its dealings with other communities is more in the hands of men than women. However, should a man not have a suitable wife, this would affect his position and even make it untenable, since even at this level the unity of the couple as a unit is important. It is certain men, always the male half of the leading couple of their own longhouse or multilonghouse community, who represent the community in affairs involving other communities, and who become leaders of federations of longhouses … It appears that in the recent past, before the Second [207] World War, there were, broadly, two federations of longhouses in the Kelabit Highlands proper (not including those longhouses outside the Highlands whose inhabitants had emigrated from the Highlands within the previous 100 years or so - see chapter two). These two federations might be termed northern and southern. Each had a leader, who might be drawn from any of the constituent longhouses."" (Janowski, 1991, pp. 206-207)",janowski1991[203-207]

The only religious specialists mentioned are babablyan (shamans or spirit mediums). The religious role of the datu (chief) appears to have been minimal, though he is described as 'sponsoring' sacrifices. The babalyan had authority in the sense that only he or she could perform certain sacrifices. The largest of these appear to have been on a 'community' or 'village' scale:

""Part of ordinary river traffic were little rafts – or, in the case of community sacrifices, large ones – headed downstream bearing the offerings and paraphernalia of ceremonies celebrated along their banks. As for spirits dwelling in the mountains, hunters were sure to offer their first catch to them."" (Scott, 1994, p. 78)

""Paganito were basically seances – that is, ceremonies in which a medium established audible communication with spirits … Minor paganito … could be performed by any householder … But solemn paganito had to be conducted by a babaylan. 
Babaylan were shamans or spirit mediums, given to seizures and trances in which they spoke with the voice of diwata and other spirits and acted out conflicts in the spirit world … They came to their calling through attacks of illness or insanity which could only be cured by accepting the call, and then attached themselves as alabay, apprentices, to some older babaylan, frequently a relative. Their renumeration was a designated share of the offerings, usually choice cuts of the hog or the head. But in full-scale paganito sponsored by prominent datus, they went home with heirloom valuables like porcelain plates or gold ornaments … This worship took place in private homes or fields; at grave sites or sacred spots outside the community; or along beaches or streams where little rafts could be launched, aboard which were disease and bad luck, or live pests like locusts or rats. There were no temples, though there were little platforms or sheds at the entrance to the village where offerings were made. Some paganito were for the benefit of individuals or kindred, some were by nature seasonal, and some sought relief from a public crisis like drought or pestilence.""

Visayan 'communities' were led by a datu, who had very clear authority within the community. There is no clear evidence for supralocal authority. Groups of communities formed 'federations' around a particularly powerful datu, which Scott calls 'chiefdoms', but in fact they appear to have had no institutionalised power over their subordinate datu:

“The head of a Visayan community was a datu, what the Spaniards called principal, chief or a ‘lord of vassals,’ and kadatoan were those datus regarded as autonomous. The word meant both a political office and a social class, both an incumbent ruler and all members of the ruling class of either sex ... There was no word for a primary datu or paramount chief, but those recognized as primus inter pares were known as pangulo, head or leader; kaponoan, most sovereign … or makaporos nga datu, a unifying chief. Those who controlled seaports with foreign trade generally took Malay-Sanskrit titles like Rajah (Ruler), Batara (Noble Lord), or ‘Sarripada’ (His Highness). Magellan met three chiefs called ‘rajah’ – Awi of Butuan,  Kolambu of Limawasa, and Humabon of Cebu – a title Spaniards always translated as king, though Magellan learned too late that they had neither kingdoms nor power over other datus ... [129] ... These datus were part of what social anthropologists call a chiefdom -  a loose federation of chiefs bound by loose ties of personal allegiance to a senior among them. The head of such a chiefdom exercised authority over his supporting chiefs, but not over their subjects or territory, and his primacy stepped from his control of local or foreign trade, and the ability to redistribute luxury goods desired by the others ... [130] ... A datu was expected to govern his people, settle their disputes, protect them from enemies, and lead them in battle. He was assisted by a considerable staff....” (Scott, 1994, pp 128-130)

""A datu’s following was his haop or dolohan, Visayan terms to which Tagalog barangay was added after Manila became the colonial capital. These terms all referred to the people themselves, not the place where they lived … and they ranged in size from thirty to a hundred households ... The village and towns where one or more haop lived were bongto or lungsod; and hamlets or neighbourhoods were hamuro, a cluster of houses within earshot. Community decisions affecting more than one haop required datu consensus, and so did alliances between settlements. But there were no formal confederations, for which reason Spanish explorers always made blood compacts with more than one chief, from chiefs of Samar hamlets too small to be seen from the coast to those of large communities like Cebu spread out for several kilometres.""

“Group leadership in the precolonial Marovo polity of headhunting coastal people was concentrated in the three important institutionalized positions of bangara, varane, and chiama, each of which was normally found in every corporate bububutu. The first and highest-ranking was the largely hereditary position of leader (bangara) of ‘group politics’ or binangara. The bangara held the important ancestral skulls and shell valuables of the butubutu, regulated the use of and access to the ancestral territory, kept genealogical information, organized feasts and other important ceremonial activities, as well as the manufacture and exchange of clamshell valuables, and was the most powerful among the ‘important men’ (palabatu) of his group … Each bangara had as his functionary one or more leading warriors (varane, literally ‘brave, warriorlike’’), whose responsibility was to organize and lead warriors of the butubutu (including temporary associates) in raiding, feuding, and warfare … A chiama (head priest) was likewise attached to each bangara. His job was to organize religious ceremonies and to mediate between the bangara and the spirit world on behalf of the butubutu. One of the main tasks of chiama was to secure tinamanae (foreseeable bestowal of efficacy – a causative noun construct based on mana) for the butubutu’s actities, largely through sacrifices to, and divinatory communication with, ancestral spirits (poda). Although bangara and other influential persons … could perform minor sacrifices and communicate with ancestral spirits at lesser shrines, chiama had overall responsibility for ceremonial activity at major shrines such as the oru where skulls of former bangara are kept and where human sacrifice was performed.” (Hviding, 1996, pp 86-87)",hviding1996[86-88]

A second leader, at least in the ideal model Malaita peoples have of their own social order, is a Melanesian-style big man, an entrepreneurial feastgiver … The third in the triumvirate of traditional leadership was the ramo or warrior: an assassin, a bounty hunter, a war leader. (Keesing, 1982, p. 11)

Elsewhere, Keesing makes it clear that of the three types of leadership in Malaita society, only priesthood was an office:

""For the religious officiant of a descent group Kwaio most often use wane naa ba'e ‘man of the shrine,’ although the north Malaita fataabu is also in use … For a feastgiving and stability-maintaining leader like 'Elota, Kwaio use wane ba'ita, ‘big man,’ or, mainly in contexts of neo-Maasina Rule leadership, the southern-derived term alafa (‘chief’). Like northern Malaita peoples the Kwaio had ideas of a secular leader whose political sway would be exercised across a broad region; but for these anarchically inclined and fiercely egalitarian hillbillies, this was a unity probably never achieved (the usual label for such a leader, alafa ni gela, ‘Gela Chief,’ belies its alien origin). For a warrior leader / bounty-hunter, Kwaio use lamo, or wane lamo … [243] … In sociological terms, only the ‘priest’ occupied a position every descent group had to fill. A ‘big man’ is ‘big’ only in relative terms, and some descent groups had no prominent secular leader … A group in which a strong feast-giving leader had emerged acted with greater unity, at more intensified levels of production and exchange activity, than  a group without such a leader. But a set of men none of whom was a prominent leader and feastgiver could act together and singly to stage mortuary feasts and organize bridewealth exchanges when the occasion arose … So the wane ba'ita was ‘big’ as a matter of degree; and in no sense was the Big Man a leadership position within the descent group, at least among the Kwaio … So, too, the wane lamo in no sense occupied a position within a Kwaio descent group. As will be seen, such a man was believed to have special ancestrally-conferred powers. But his lamo-ness was a matter of degree and context. While everyone agreed that a small array of feared bounty hunters of the 1920s were lamo … there were many men, warriors of lesser fame and power, who in some contexts would be classed as wane lamo."" (Keesing, 1985, pp 242-245)

Priests appear to have had no official secular functions, though they may have been big-men or warriors at an earlier stage in their lives:

""Some men are oriented primarily toward the sacred, as custodians of ritual knowledge and intermediaries between the group and the spirits. Such priests are not necessarily attributed power in secular pursuits, and have no substantial political role in secular life except as channels through whom [207] the ancestors communicate … But in a number of other cases, a man who in his seventies or eighties was a revered and sacrided priest had decades earlier been a feared warrior or renowned feastgiver … Secular power deemed to be ancestrally conferred is, as it were, sacralised by age in the life cycle, as a strong man approaches ancestorhood.""

18063,kwaraae,86,0,150-0,"Tricky. The principal leaders in Kwara’ae society were fataabu, usually translated ‘priest’ but sometimes ‘chief’. There were also ‘land leaders’ (etaeta), a status that was to some extent shared by all patrilineal descendants of a founding ancestor, but was more particularly vested in the senior male of the senior line. The positions of ‘priest’ and ‘land leader’ ‘ideally’ coincided. Exactly what the land leader did is not quite clear, but the role seems to have involved ‘management’ of the land of a local clan and acting as a ‘representative’ of that local clan. It appears to have been possible for a priest to act as land leader without actually being the acknowledged land leader, which suggests that the rights and duties of this role were not strictly vested in the office of either ‘priest’ or ‘land leader’.  

While the religious functions of some priests clearly went beyond the local community, this does not appear to have been the case for the role of land leader. Priests are also described as engaging in ‘redistribution’ through the sacrificial system. 

""The priest (fataābu) whom the ancestors chose to mediate between them and the living was ideally the firstborn man of the senior line, so that the list of principal ancestors through which the clan traced its descent would often be conceived as a list of successive priests who were also the leaders for the land. (Burt, 1994, p. 27)

""The priest’s congregation and sphere of influence centred on his local clan group of fathers, brothers and sons and their families … Even if the priest was not also the most senior by descent and hence technically leader for the land, he would be the main authority on the genealogies demonstrating this leadership, which he had to recite during sacrifices to the ancestors concerned. Historical accounts and present opinion … both confirm that priests acted as land leaders and representatives of their local clans. In the 1960s Ramo’itolo of Latea gave a memorable demonstration of this role in several land disputes with neigbours of other clans.

""[68] But the priest’s essential duty and the source of his authority was to mediate with the ghosts, invoking their support and protection and making good offences against them … In fulfilling his responsibilities, he acted as the moral guardian of his people, ensuring that they treated the ghosts and each other as tabu and led lives which were righteous … and ‘clean’ … Sickness and calamity could result not only from offences against the ghosts themselves, but also from conflict among their dependants, such as quarrels or killings, sexual improprieties, incest and improper marriages. As the Christian preacher Didi’imae puts it, a priest was ‘like a big pastor’ … He was expected to demonstrate in his own life the values which distinguished an ‘important man’, living quietly and humbly, staying at home at prospering by working hard on his gardens, raising pigs and acquiring shell money with which to help others. Indeed some say that priests were always ‘important men’, even though ‘important men’ were not always priests. 

""As ‘important men’, priests contributed to exchanges of wealth and feasting through the sacrificial system, receiving on behalf of the ghosts both pigs and shell money offerings used to buy pigs, which were shared with other adult men in sacrificial meals and festivals. Sacrifices to ancestors also brought together their dependants within the local clan and beyond. When people were asked for pigs by ancestors from whom they were ‘born of women’, the sacrifice reaffirmed relationships with uncles and cousins in other clans, and claims to their clan lands. When they sent pigs ‘up’ to the ancient ancestors of their own clan at the shrines they derived from generations ago, they joined a wider congregation of local clans under the leadership of a priest of the senior line. The priests in charge of the ancient shrines of dispersed clans … had special opportunities for leadership through the hierarchical descent system."" (Burt, 1994, pp. 67-69)

""In describing priests as the true ‘important men’ of the past, Kwara’ae are voicing the ideal, which many hold as Christians, that society should be governed by spiritual rather than by secular authority, making the point that the two were inseparable in Kwara’ae traditional society. There may well be good reason to follow the Kwara’ae usage and call their priests ‘chiefs’, both to acknowledge ‘prevailing conceptions of chiefly leadership’ … and to recognise that they were engaged in what Sahlins calls ‘chiefly redistribution’ through the sacrificial system."" (Burt, 1994, p. 76)

Other leaders also existed, but appear not to have occupied defined offices, with the possible exception of the ‘official warrior’ (ramo to’ofu):

""Certain trained warriors (ramo to’ofu) were authorised by their community to enforce tabu, leading organised raids and assassinating appropriate victims to uphold the ‘law’, obtain restitution or collect rewards. For some clans this role is said to have been inherited, in a different line of descent to the senior priest. But unlike priests, official warriors were not essential to community life. Most men had to be prepared to fight on occasion and the title ‘warrior’ was probably applied loosely to any man who gained a reputation as a successful fighter … Quite how important warriors were as political leaders is difficult to say. The Kwara’ae view today is that they had little authority, for despite the wealth they obtained by collecting rewards, killing prevented them from gaining the popularity and prestige of an ‘important man’. But the authority of priests depended partly on the violent deeds of warriors to enforce the rules of tabu, as warriors depended on priests and ghosts to empower and authorise their deeds … But Kwara’ae share with other Malaitans the ideal of a tripartite leadership in which the roles of priest and warrior are complemented by wealthy feastgivers or ‘important men’ of the Melanesian ‘big man’ type, represent three interdependent spheres of political activity. Political power depended on the economic obligations to senior men which bound communities together but it was backed by the sanction of violence and supported by the spiritual power of [75] ghosts. The leadership of priests, warriors, and ‘important men’ has been documented by various writers for most other language areas of Malaita from Kwaio northwards (Ivens 1930, Hogbin 1939, Russell 1950, Ross 1973, 1978a, all cited in Keesing 1985). These descriptions often have a tendency to see the titles of leaders as definitions of roles or even formal offices, reflecting perhaps a Western expectation that leadership be specialised and institutionalised … In Kwara’ae priests are said to have been all these things too. But although priests could be said to hold formal office, ‘important man’ (ngwae ‘inoto’a, ngawae lalifu) was more a descriptive title, as ‘warrior’ probably was in many cases too.""

18065,lau,86,2,150-2,"Settlement: Most Lau lived in very small, densely populated 'artificial islands' (fera) in the lagoon that would seem to have constituted 'local communities' (ndeed, one meaning of 'fera' is 'village'. There were also a few villages onshore (Ivens, 1930, pp. 48-50, 81-81). 

'Social organization': Ivens (1930, pp. 75-92)

Fera had 'chiefs', but there is no mention of any chiefs with authority over multiple fera. There was a lagoon-wide office called 'Aofia' whose role was to be 'the embodiment of peace', but this office was only filled very irregularly, and in any case appears to have involved no authority. 

""Each island is an entity in itself, a fera, and each person on the island who is of the family, is spoken of as ‘aei fera (belonging to the fera). The word fera denotes primarily a village, and is a common Mala word. In Lau, as is natural, fera bears the additional meaning of artificial island … "" (Ivens, 1930, pp 80-81)

""The Lau chiefs are chiefs by virtue of their birth, and not because of any prowess which they may manifest, or any wealth which they may amass, or any spiritual power which may manifest itself in them. Their functions are distinct from those of the priests, who are of the same lineage with them; but on given occasions they have the right to sacrifice to their ancestors. The phrase fisi kwau (top branches), which is used of chiefs, is an evidence of how chiefs are regarded in Lau. Little actual government, as we understand the term, was exercised by them in the past.

""They were not the dispensers of justice for their people. Indeed, there was nothing in the life or conduct of the people that would create any necessity for such administration of justice. Everything was ruled by custom and convention, and all breaches of it were condemned by public opinion."" (Ivens, 1930, p 84)

""The Government had a difficult task in the pacification of the Mala peoples, and in the carrying out of the enactments which they drew up for the administration of the islands. There were no paramount chiefs with whom to confer, no council of elders in the various places who could be entrusted with the establishment of law and order."" (Ivens, 1930, p 86)

""The chiefs in Lau are still responsible for the carrying out of the big feasts, and these feasts are the most important things that occur in the social life of the communities as a whole. The fishing grounds are the property of chiefs, as also are the fishing-nets. Technically, the garden ground is also their property; but in practice the family of a given chief is free to work the garden ground … The chiefs are wealthy members of the community. In Lau they amass money through their ownership of fishing nets."" (Ivens, 1930, p 87)

""It was the chiefs in Lau who decided upon the waging of war, or the making of reprisals for any insult offered to them or their people. They themselves accompanied war parties and fought with them. In the event of blood-money being offered for the killing of a person, the provision of such moneys was the business of the chiefs."" (Ivens, 1930, p 88)

Angasi kao, the present head chief of Sulu Vou, after a quarrel with one of his fellow chiefs, went off in a fit of sulks to Ngwalo with his wives and a few of his people … During his absence the other chiefs remained at Sulu Vou. (Ivens, 1930, pp 88-89)

""An instance of the general peaceable character of the Lau is afforded by the appointment of one of the chiefs to be Aofia ... The Lau Aofia was a man of chiefly rank, an actual chief at the time of his appointment, or the son of a chief, who was formally dedicated to be the embodiment in himself of peace ... The motive underlying the appointment of an Aofia was that there should be present among the Lau peoples one whose influence was exercised to keep the peace. The succession does not appear to have been maintained regularly, but at least four men have occupied the position since the days of Leo of Sulu Vou ... Doubtless his efforts would be directed mainly towards the maintenance of peace between the Lau peoples, who felt themselves to be all one family. The opposition of the ancestral ghosts would not be likely to manifest itself in the case of war between Lau and Tolo. It was the introduction of firearms that caused a break in the succession of the Aofia, and set the Lau peoples fighting among themselves."" (Ivens, 1930, pp 90-91).","ivens1930[48-50, 75-92]"

18064,kwaio,84,3,149-3,"The Kwaio lived in fanua (‘shrine territories’), each of which was the property of a small descent group and contained a number of tiny ‘settlements’:

""According to Kwaio traditions of their past, the land was first cleared some twelve to twenty generations ago. The pioneer settlers cleared primary forest for gardens, and in doing so they and their descendants progressively established title over named tracts of secondary forest. The founding settlers, coming from an established territory, established a shrine to their ancestors, linked to the parent shrine … In time, a patchwork of named tracts and associated settlement sites, with a focal shrine and often several branch shrines, expanded to the margins of another group's territory. Such a cluster of land tracts, title to which was held by descendents of the founding ancestors, comprises a fanua 'shrine territory' ... Each fanua is, or once was, the estate of a small descent group, comprising those descendents of the founding ancestors who have a primary commitment to that territory and shrine … [16] … As of late 1927, when the Kwaio mountains were first pacified, the mean number of adult men per descent group was 8.68, the range 3 to 20 – small even by the standards of seaboard Melanesia (Hogbin and Wedgwood 1953) … [18] … Kwaio settlements were tiny, even by Melanesian standards … As of 1928, Kwaio settlements ranged in size from 2 to 29, with a mean of 9.95. The number of component households ranged from 1 to 8, with a mean of 2.19. Usually settlements were moved every few years, although a few old settlement sites had been occupied continuously for several generations. The fluidity of residence meant a circulation through the named land tracts of a fanua; each tract has an old settlement site, characteristically reoccupied several times in a lifetime."" (Keesing, 1982, pp. 17-18)

Each local descent group had a ‘priest’, whose official role appears to have been solely religious:

""Each descent group normally has one 'priest' ... who acts as officiant when the group sacrifices to its principal ancestors ... on their behalf. In ideal circumstances he is a senior [88] man agnatically descended from the founding ancestors ... A priest is not a full-time ritual specialist: in everyday life he works and lives in ways scarcely different from his fellows … ... But when he acts as officiant in important rites, he enters into sacred and dangerous communion with the ancestors, requiring special isolation and sacredness. Many men find these rules, particularly those enjoining chastity, onerous; hence succession to the responsibilities a priest carries is not always eagerly sought … In theory, it is the ancestors themselves who choose a successor to become priest, through divination … But where a man has been thoroughly trained by an aging [89] priest (ideally, his father) to succeed him, the outcome would be a foregone conclusion (if it were put to divination at all)."" (Keesing, 1982, pp 87-89) 

""Some men are oriented primarily toward the sacred, as custodians of ritual knowledge and intermediaries between the group and the spirits. Such priests are not necessarily attributed power in secular pursuits, and have no substantial political role in secular life except as channels through whom [207] the ancestors communicate … But in a number of other cases, a man who in his seventies or eighties was a revered and sacrided priest had decades earlier been a feared warrior or renowned feastgiver … Secular power deemed to be ancestrally conferred is, as it were, sacralised by age in the life cycle, as a strong man approaches ancestorhood."" (Keesing, 1982, pp. 206-207) 

Local descent groups are described as ‘fully autonomous’, but groups of them often formed single congregations from time to time:

""Throughout Malaita, both agnatic descent - down through lines of men from the founding ancestors - and cognatic descent - through links of out-marrying women - are important ... Politically, local descent groups seem to have been largely autonomous, despite the conceptualization in terms of regional clusters reminiscent of the much larger-scale phatries of highland New Guinea. In the central zone that includes Kwaio - geographically the most mountainous and fragmented sector of the island - small scale local descent groups are fully autonomous (although linked together by ritual interconnections, as we will see for Kwaio in chapter 6."" (Keesing, 1982, p 10).

""We can see from these diagrams that a wide range of Kwaio in different descent groups trace relationships to and propitiate the same ancient ancestors. Thus the congregation united by common relatedness to Amadia or La?aka is large and dispersed. (We will see that individuals propitiate a half-dozen or more of these ancient ancestors, so that there is substantial overlap between a category of descendants of Amadia and of descendants of La?aka or Kwateta.) These broad categories have limited significance. La?aka as sacrificed at A?ofolo is regarded as a sort of different manifestation of the adalo than La?aka as sacrificed at Fouafoafo?o, using a different complex of magic. But there are contexts, as we will see, where all ritually senior males related to La?aka can partake of a sacrifice together; or where all relatives of La?aka comprise a temporarily relevant social category. 

""The genealogies maintained by descent group priests and other knowledgeable men and women are generally similar in structure. They begin with a founding ancestor … [78] … But the most powerful ancestor(s) propitiated by the descent groups may not be the founders(s) … Thus Amadia is the princioal ancestor of (among other groups) Giru?i, Naangari, and Darilari; and La?aka is the principal ancestor of (among other groups) A?ofolo, Fouafoafo?a, and Kafusiisigi. By traditional ties of intermarriage, members of a descent group will not only sacrifice to their own focal ancestor(s) through their own priest … but will propitiate the powerful ancestors of other groups, though priests of those groups … Pairs of descent groups with contiguous lands represent the outcome of segmentation and concurrent ritual segmentation. In such a case, one is regarded as senior, the other junior ... These relationships are expressed ritually in procedures of sacrifice, through coparticipation of both priests.""

18067,lau,84,3,149-3,"The Lau lived on thirty-two artificial islands (fera) in a large lagoon. These islands fell into three geographical ‘groups’ (Ivens, 1930, p. 49). All of the Lau (or at least all of the Lau chiefs) seemed to have considered themselves to be descended from a common ancestor, Leo, and this was also true of the three subgroups (Ivens, 1930, pp. 57, 59, 64). The Lau felt themselves to be ‘one family’, and at times acknowledged a leader or representative called the Aofia, whose role was to ‘keep the peace’. The first three had also been ‘priests of the ancestral worship on Sulu Vou’, but the last was simply a ‘chief’. While the role of Aofia was given legitimacy by supernatural beliefs, it is not clear that the role itself carried any specifically religious duties.

""An instance of the general peaceable character of the Lau is afforded by the appointment of one of the chiefs to be Aofia ... The Lau Aofia was a man of chiefly rank, an actual chief at the time of his appointment, or the son of a chief, who was formally dedicated to be the embodiment in himself of peace ...

It was to the interest of the Aofia to maintain peace, for it was held that if peace was broken the ancestral ghosts would kill the Aofia. Doubtless his efforts would be directed mainly towards the maintenance of peace between the Lau peoples, who felt themselves to be all one family. The opposition of [91] the ancestral ghosts would not be likely to manifest itself in the case of war between Lau and Tolo. It was the introduction of firearms that caused a break in the succession of the Aofia, and set the Lau peoples fighting among themselves."" (Ivens, 1930, pp 90-91).

Each island had two priests - one for the ancestor cult and one for the cult of sharks and war ghosts:

""PRIESTS are called hata aabu (holy name) in Lau … In general practice each large island has two priests, one for the ancestral worship, the other for the war ghosts and the shark worship.""(Ivens, 1930, p 149)

A hierarchy among the priests of different islands is not evident. However, the cults of certain supernatural agents worshipped throughout the lagoon (and perhaps beyond) was in the hands of the priests of particular islands:

""""These war ghosts are not the ancestors of their worshippers like the ordinary agalos are … The official worship of Sina Kwao, the right of sacrificing to him, is entirely in the hands of Buga, who is [142] a Fuaga man."" (Ivens, 1930, pp. 141-142)

""The Ada Gege people sacrificed pigs to Sina Kwao at Sulu Vou after the murder of three of their young men … The pigs were taken to Sulu Vou for Buga to offer."" (Ivens, 1930, p. 147)

""Buga is also the one man at Sulu Vou who has to do with the worship of sharks. There is no shark altar at Sulu Vou, but certain attentions are paid there to those ancestors who are incarnate in sharks. The big shark altar is at Fuaga, with Buga as the priest … Buga is sent for to conduct the ceremonies at the big feasts, and to make the sacrifices to the ancestral ghosts in many places south of Sulu Vou, both on the artificial islands and up on the foothills."" (Ivens, 1930, p. 151)

""Some of the artificial islands have shark altars on them, others have a shark bae on the shore … Sulu Vou made use of ‘O’ona’s bae at Manu eu behind the present village of Fou I’ia … Fuaga has a shark altar which is served by Buga, and a big pig is killed and eaten there when a chief’s son belonging to one of the neighbouring islands is afflicted with sores."" (Ivens, 1930, p. 158)

""O’ona of Manu eu, who invited Leo to come and settle [165] near him, was a shark priest, and there were two shark altars at Manu eu … Sacrifices of pigs were made at the altars to ancestral sharks, i.e. to dead and gone ancestors of O’ona, who were said to be incarnate in sharks. The shark worship at Manu eu must therefore have been in existence long before the days when Leo settled in the neighbourhood. The Manu eu priests confined their attention mainly to the shark worship, but they had power over crocodiles as well … Leo, after settling on Sulu Vou, did not build a shark altar, and his descendants who were married to Manu eu women participated in the shark worship at shore altars.""

Within the village, there is neither a formal leadership with political specialists nor social classes differentiated in terms of wealth, status, or power.” (Yu, 1991, p. 47)

""The Yami differentiate themselves internally into subgroups whose identities and memberships are arrived at by a variety of criteria – the sharing of an apical ancestor, the joint use of an irrigation system, the common investment in a fishing net, co-residence in a neighbourhood, etc. I heard two terms used to label all such groups: asa su inawan and asa itetngehan … These terms were used to denote people who were descendants of a certain common ancestor (although they were not necessarily lineally related) … In the last week of my stay in Iraralei, a respected village elder told me that there were in fact four itetngehans in the village … The function of these groups seemed only that of fighting with one another; their very reason for being appeared merely to be the fact of their mutually antagonistic co-existence. The eldest man within each group, whom everyone referred to as nirakeh, served as group leader. On occasion, the leadership post might go to a younger, wealthy man if the oldest man within a group happened to be poor. Whenever a dispute would arise between two groups, all members of a given group would meet in the nirakeh’s house, there to discuss whether to turn to violence in resolution of the problem. The final decision rested ultimately in the hands of the nirakeh. More research is necessary to determine how such groups recruited their members, and to see if there were other functions that they performed."" (Yu, 1991, p. 55)","yu-1991[47, 55]"

18071,palau,86,3,150-3,"‘Traditional political institutions’ (Parmentier, 1987, pp 55-106)

Villages and larger groupings:

""Beginning with the village itself as the basic political unit, the discussion considers four levels of multivillage association: village complexes, consisting of satellite hamlets surrounding a dominant village; districts, which group together member villages around a focal capital village; subdistrict divisions within a single district; and shifting federations of villages from different districts. The system of titles and councils is then characterized as the primary means of decision making and as a clear expression of the principle of social rank."" (Parmentier, 1987, p. 55)

Villages, village complexes and districts:

""As was noted above, villages are grouped into several types of political associations which will be provisionally glossed as village complexes, districts, subdistricts, and federations …  Village complexes are groups of satellite hamlets surrounding a dominant capital village. These smaller hamlets are not themselves fully autonomous villages, in that their component houses are affiliated with the principal or chiefly houses in the capital village ... These satellite hamlets are often founded by immigrant groups who are permitted to build houses in the ‘suburban’ perimeter of the capital or by overflow from overpopulated principal houses ... Districts (renged, from merenged, ‘tie together’), the second type of multivillage association, are far more important than village complexes for understanding political history, since it is at the interdistrict level that institutions such as tribute, concubinage, warfare, ceremonial dancing, and financial exchanges took place ... [61] ... Like village complexes, districts consist of dependent villages affiliated with a dominant capital village. But in the case of districts, member villages are fully distinct entities with titleholders, houses, and clubs that are not merely subservient to the corresponding institutions at the capital. Furthermore, villages in the district maintain political relationships of various sorts with villages in other districts, ties that do not necessarily pass through the capital. Kubary (1885:116–17) even mentions a case in which a member village kept up peaceful relations with a village in a neighboring district which was at war with its capital village.” (Parmentier, 1987, pp. 60-61)

Subdistricts:

“This grouping of villages within a district often took the form of structured opposition between two opposed subdistricts, each controlled by a different chiefly house at the capital or by two chiefs from cocapital villages. In several cases the existence of named subdistricts points to a previous stage of political consolidation before the emergence of a single district chief and a dominant capital village. Ngerekldeu district, for example, is divided into subdistricts named Ngerusekluk or Ngos (East) and Ngeremenganged or Ngebard (West). According to one account, the chiefs Kloteraol, head of the eastern group of villages, and Rubasech, head of the western group, were in constant competition until their opposition was successfully mediated by a wise person from Oreor village, to whom they yielded overall authority and for whom they invented the new title Ibedul (Head) (Kubary 1885:68–69).

Relative looseness of district organization:

""Based on these comments on the dual structure of several districts and on the overarching control by chiefs at the capital, it is possible to overstate the level of political integration of districts. First of all, rank differentiation of capital and member villages was not accompanied by an inclusive or linear ranking of all the district's villages, nor was there a cross-district system of village rank as found, for example, in Yap (Labby 1976; Lingenfelter 1975; Schneider 1949) ... Second, there is little evidence from stories and chants that there existed a districtwide council of chiefs over and above the ruling council at the capital. In the most detailed published accounts of district organization, namely Aoyagi's study of Ngerard and Kubary's study of Ngetelngal, no mention is made of a district council ... In the modern period, however, [65] when most districts became chartered ‘municipalities’ under the Trust Territory government and then ‘ ‘states’ under the national constitution, district councils have been created which have actually usurped most of the absolute authority of councils at capital villages.  Also, a unifying pan-Belauan council of chiefs, the Rubekul a Belau (Elders of Belau), representing all the district capitals, developed only under pressure from colonial administrations.” (Parmentier, 1987, pp. 64-65)

'Federations':

“Federations, the final type of multivillage association to be noted, consist of networks of shifting alliances among villages from several districts. Although the same term, renged, ‘tied together,’ is used for federations and districts, the diachronic stability of districts is not matched in the case of federations, which were the product of military expansion of a powerful village, the temporary solidarity of villages allied against a common enemy, or the result of kinship and marriage ties shared by local representatives of high-ranking house affiliation networks. Membership in federations involved mutual assistance in war, pooled contributions to support the financial obligations of village chiefs, and reciprocal visiting to celebrate the taking of a head trophy or to perform elaborate dances.” (Parmentier, 1987, p 65)

The village council:

""The village's foreign policy (kelulau) is the total responsibility of between four and ten officeholders who sit together as the decision-making council (klobak). The title system is the most important point of articulation between the sphere of domestic activity (tekoi er a blai) and the sphere of public activity (tekoi er a buai), since titleholders are simultaneously heads of houses and members of village councils … Each title is a named office which exists independently from the person holding the position at any one time ... [68] ... Belauan titleholders resemble Tikopia chiefs more than Solomon Island big men, in that the sacredness (meang) and power (klisiich) surrounding them derive from their carrying a title which occupies a permanent position in the village's social hierarchy rather than merely from the skill, achievements, and personal charisma of individual incumbents ... The person who holds the title is called rubak... Since houses claiming titles are themselves ranked in each village, the rubak of the highest-ranking house is also the leader (merredel) or ‘head of the village.’ This position is symbolized by his assigned seat in the village meetinghouse, by his claim of precedence in ceremonial food distribution, and by expressions of respect and deference by villagers. The chief's head, the most tabooed part of his body, must never be touched; his food is served in specially covered containers; his seat in the meetinghouse must not be occupied by anyone other than his children at play; villagers must detour off the path when the chief passes; and at his death the chief receives a more elaborate funeral rite than lesser titleholders. Above all, the chief ‘carries the voice of the village,’ in that his speech has the force of law."" (Parmentier, 1987, pp 67-68)

“Titleholders representing their local houses meet regularly in the village meetinghouse to discuss matters of public interest: strategies for warfare, arrangements for entertaining visiting parties, debates over the level of fines, imposition of regulations for exploiting the village's agricultural and fishing resources, adjudication of disputes over land [72] ownership, collection of money to pay for concubine groups, decisions to repair or construct a new meetinghouse, instruction in village history and traditions, and the acceptance of new members to the council. An informant summarized these various activities under the categories ‘inventing laws’ (melibech a llach), ‘conducting foreign affairs’ (oltobed er a kelulau), and ‘keeping the village in order’ (mengetmokl er a beluu).” (Parmentier, 1987, pp 71-72)",parmentier1987[55-106]

""Dwellings are distributed in a somewhat ragged line along the island's southern shoreline. The closest the Anutans have to a term for 'village' is noporanga, which literally means 'dwelling place.' Villages are not demarcated by any physical boundary."" (Feinberg, 1991, pp. 13-14)

Chiefs:

""Anuta is a small-scale Polynesian chiefdom … Anuta is divided into four ranked ‘clans’ (kainanga). The two senior kainanga are led by chiefs (ariki); the remaining two are not. The senior chief is known as Te Ariki Mua (‘The Chief in Front’) or Tui Anuta; the junior chief is Te Ariki Muri (‘The Chief in Back’) or Tui Kainanga."" (Feinberg, 1991, p. 15)

""Chiefs in theory, and to some degree in fact, exercise dominion over all land and natural resources. Because they are considered to be descended from the premier deities, they acted as high priests in the traditional religious system. Even today they are endowed with awesome mana by the Christian God, and they are expected to utilize their mana to protect the community's wellbeing. They organize public works activities, control the ritual cycle, place taboos on crops or parcels of land, and are presented with tribute in the form of first fruit payments and highly esteemed fish. These goods are often redistributed either informally or at feasts. In addition, reciprocity, combined with a sense of noblesse oblige, leads the chiefs to redistribute much of their own garden produce."" (Feinberg, 1988, p. 293)

20771,yami,85,2,151-2,"‘Social organization’ (Yu, 1991, pp. 47-71)

Although formal leadership roles are denied, two examples are in fact mentioned, one political and one religious. No indication of any overlap in functions, but the religious office was at a higher hierarchical level (the village) than the political office was (the four kin groups into which the village was divided):

“There are six villages on Botel Tobago. Every village is an autonomous polity. No island-wide political authority has ever existed. Within the village, there is neither a formal leadership with political specialists nor social classes differentiated in terms of wealth, status, or power.” (Yu, 1991, p. 47)

""The Yami differentiate themselves internally into subgroups whose identities and memberships are arrived at by a variety of criteria – the sharing of an apical ancestor, the joint use of an irrigation system, the common investment in a fishing net, co-residence in a neighbourhood, etc. I heard two terms used to label all such groups: asa su inawan and asa itetngehan … These terms were used to denote people who were descendants of a certain common ancestor (although they were not necessarily lineally related) … In the last week of my stay in Iraralei, a respected village elder told me that there were in fact four itetngehans in the village … The function of these groups seemed only that of fighting with one another; their very reason for being appeared merely to be the fact of their mutually antagonistic co-existence. The eldest man within each group, whom everyone referred to as nirakeh, served as group leader. On occasion, the leadership post might go to a younger, wealthy man if the oldest man within a group happened to be poor. Whenever a dispute would arise between two groups, all members of a given group would meet in the nirakeh’s house, there to discuss whether to turn to violence in resolution of the problem. The final decision rested ultimately in the hands of the nirakeh. More research is necessary to determine how such groups recruited their members, and to see if there were other functions that they performed."" (Yu, 1991, p. 55)

“There is only one exception to the Yami preference for social levelling. This is the permanent leadership status called makangawul (whose incumbent is charged with regularly officiating at the flying fish ceremonies, see Chapters 4 and 5). Certain ritual privileges accrue to this individual (e.g. his own and his fishing group’s boats are always the first to put out to sea, and no one may start performing their respective ritual obligations before he has started to perform his). In all other respects, however, he is treated as the equal of the other villages.” (Yu, 1991, p. 65)",yu-1991[47-71]

The village and the tribal group:

""It is comparatively simple to describe the main features of the smallest of the Batak corporate groups, the village; and the highest, the tribal group. Below the village there is only the hamlet; above the tribal group there is only the Batak people as such. It is what lies between these two extremes that presents the difficulty."" (Vergouwen, 1964, p. 105)

The village chief:

""The authority in the village is usually the village head who is known by various titles: radja huta being the most usual one … It is he who is charged with the management of the village and the maintenance of law and custom, order and discipline. He is the patrilineal descendant of the founder of the village who was the first radja huta. This office, if possible, is passed from father to son, or to an uaris. Formerly a village chief was required to have more qualities than at present now that peace prevails. The village head's administration is as diverse as are the aspects of village life. He is responsible for the maintenance of the village square and the walls; he regulates the alignment of the houses and controls the lands of the village. He can decide whether a small garden must be given up in order to make room for a house or whether it can remain; he guides the legal conduct of his dependents and stands by them if they have to make a claim against anyone, or in the event of their creditors making too many difficulties for them. He conducts [116] their betrothal deliberations when their children marry. He represents the interests of his village and of his lineage where there is involvement with the outside world. And, though he has been pushed into the background in recent years, he is still the authority in the village who executes the orders of the higher authority. Formerly he was responsible for the administration of justice also ... The inhabitants of the village must accept his leadership and be guided by him and as proof of this they must honour him in such transactions as marriages, the sale of cattle, alienation of land, etc., with their gifts of homage, upa radja. He, on his side, usually consults his elder subordinates, na tua-tua or pangintuai, from the foremost of whom, the namora boru, the most important man of the in-dwelling marga, he receives regular support. This is especially the case when the matter relates to a dispute between him and members of his own lineage. Nevertheless, he has the last word. And if he has to assert his chiefly authority by force in order to ensure that his orders are observed, he does so. He is the government and police in one, and in olden times he sometimes had a block standing near his house so that he could place under restraint an inhabitant who would not submit with good grace to his orders. Naturally only a powerful figure who was head and shoulders above the villagers and whose words would not be taken lightly could make a successful village head whose authority would be felt."" (Vergouwen, 1964, pp. 115-116)

The tribal group:

""It is somewhat more difficult to present such a clear picture of the tribal group for it can cover whole valleys, large tracts of lowland and plateau, extensive mountain regions, or, half the island of Samosir in Lake Toba. The difficulty is, however, lessened a little because the boundaries between the tribal areas were clearly defined and permanently established when the contending tribal groups made peace after a war. Thus it is possible to show the individual tribal areas on a map. Such boundaries were not so necessary among the marga , marga branches and lineages, or for the groupings into which they so often united to form a more or less well-defined community. Therefore boundaries within the tribal group's area were frequently not defined, for though fighting was indeed frequent within a tribal group itself, when one faction might capture the hula of another, or some people might be driven from the place in which they lived, the contestants nevertheless belonged to one larger group and if a neighbouring group threatened to invade their territory they had to combine ... [107] ... The tribal group has only one characteristic of a corporate group: its own territory. 

“With regard to centralised authority, the Toba Batak preferred in the Pidari time to live in small convenient units consisting of some hundreds of people, at most a thousand, whose interests were confined to their own affairs … The tribal group can be considered in a sense as a unit: its members have a feeling of belonging together; they are of the same blood; and they have sprung from one ancestral village where a common guardian spirit is often honoured at ceremonies to which come members of the group living elsewhere. In the past its members sometimes arranged large communal offering-feasts. They feel that their security and welfare are best promoted by living together in one tribal area and by remaining together within its confines."" (Vergouwen, 1964, pp. 106-107)

The panggomgomion ('one group governed by chiefs'):

""For a group to follow a de facto leader who is a powerful personality is rather different from following a de jure figure who has been deliberately invested with his official position by the group itself. In olden times both occurred, with, as always, their attendant phenomena. The first happened mainly where there was no durable formation of alliances with the agreements and growing usages springing therefrom. Thus in those areas where the genealogical arrangement was the prime factor in the formation of territories ... [125] ... Where a territory is a separate unit distinct from neighbouring lineages of the same or other marga [clan], even though it is also formed internally either exclusively, or mainly, genealogically...  the chief has become a more established figure for this corporate community which has had to maintain rigidly its existence as a unit ... The only point in respect of the chieftainship upon which there could be dispute was the question of assigning the chieftaincy to the rightful claimant

""Where the alliance aspect of a territory has become its predominant feature, the haradjaon = chieftainship, and its administration, panggomgomion, (from manggomgom = to rule) have been organised in a sharper and more established form. But not to the same degree or in the same manner everywhere. In Uluan, for instance, where there was not always a communal bius chief for the promotion of secular affairs concerning the whole bius, it was least apparent ... On Samosir the radja doli was recognised more clearly as the foremost chief of the bius than he was in Uluan. (Vergouwen, 1964, pp. 124-125)",vergouwen-1964[105-136]

The land of the district is the property of the butubutu, and both bear the same name … The Simboese sometimes refer to their island as Mandegugusu, ‘four places,’ and Hocart and Rivers reported these as Narovo, Karivara, Ove, and Simbo (a small offshore island more properly known as Nusa Simbo). My informants confirmed this information, but I later learned that there are in fact five major butubutu and districts, for Narovo is really a part of two districts, Vunagugusu and Katapana, each controlled by a major butubutu.” (Scheffler, 1962, p 137).  

“The account by Hocart (1922: 75-80) of local organization in 1908 refers to the districts as villages, but he notes that they were not, except for Nusa Simbo, compact groups of houses. Rather, there were numerous hamlets consisting of a few houses, each hamlet being named and further grouped into a ‘hamlet cluster’ which was also named. Each cluster was inhabited by a number of related families, and these were spoken of, in 1960, as butubutu … These smaller units are sometimes referred to as ‘branches’ (lengana) of the major butubutu, and I therefore call them minor butubutu.” (Scheffler, 1962, p 138). 

“The bangara or ‘manager’ of the butubutu was the custodian of its land … The bangara managed more than land; they managed men and their affairs as well, and the two roles did not always coincide in the same person … While there could be only one bangara peso ‘manager of the land’, there were usually others, known simply as bangara, who owed their status to managerial ability in revenge, warfare, and the ensuing feast exchanges.” (Scheffler, 1962, p 145).

“As representative of the founding butubutu Vunagugusu, the bangara of that butubutu held a nominal title to the whole of the lands of Simbo and exercised control over all uncultivated ‘wilderness’ lands. His permission was sought before one could clear any of it for gardens.” (Scheffler, 1962, p 146).",scheffler1962

At the top was the paramount chief, who was both the secular and sacred head of Kosraean society and who held ultimate title to all land. Under the paramount there were about ten high chiefs, usually male relatives that were appointed by him. The high chiefs, who were obligated to live in Lelu with the paramount, controlled named land units called facl that ran from the high mountains to the reef. There were about fifty such facl  in Kosrae … Below the high chiefs were forty or fifty low chiefs who were land managers or overseers of the facl and who resided on the land for which they were responsible. Agricultural production was primarily the responsibility of the commoners, who occupied the lowest social strata. Low chiefs saw to it that needed food, labor, and tribute were provided to the paramount and high chiefs in Lelu.” (Athens, 2007, p 262)",athens2007[262]

The land of the district is the property of the butubutu, and both bear the same name … The account by Hocart (1922:75-80) of local organization in 1908 refers to the districts as villages, but he notes that they were not, except for Nusa Simbo, compact groups of houses. Rather, there were numerous hamlets consisting of a few houses, each hamlet being named and further grouped into a ‘hamlet cluster’ which was also named. One or more clusters formed a district.""(Scheffler, 1962, pp. 137-138)

Religion was centred in the butubutu, though one ceremony was islandwide:

""Each of the major butubutu maintained its own ancestral shrines, skull houses, and other sacred places for propitiating various gods and spirits. In general, each carried out its rites independently of the others. But in at least one series of rites concerned with the productivity of the land, called by Hocart (1922:284-289) the ‘Coming Forth of the Gods,’ there was a pan- Simbo organization and significance. Only after an initial series of rites had been carried out by priests (iama) and bangara from all the butubutu in unison could each butubutu perform the cult rites concerned more specifically with its individual welfare."" (Scheffler, 1962, p. 152 )

Direct interaction with the supernatural was believed to be highly dangerous. According to Dureau (1994), all iama (‘priests’) were captives who were chosen for their role by the banara (chiefs). Their duties were overseen by a ‘senior lineage member’, who was also exposed to danger, though presumably to a lesser degree:

""The person who managed a shrine [tabuna], who led offerings and invocations, was a senior lineage member of the group attached to a particular shrine. This was a dangerous duty which nevertheless helped validate their authority in lineage matters. While senior people were responsible for ensuring the adequate observance of ancestral care and for seeking their blessing, direct involvement at shrines was preferably directed onto others. The potent ancestral forces were as potentially fickle as those of the forest tomate and the ‘priests’ (iama), those who were responsible for the care, building and supervision of tabuna and the preparation of skulls, were not those who sought political status but those who were obliged to take on the role. Such men ultimately became wealthy through the payments they extracted for their duties, but this wealth was reluctantly sought …"" (Dureau, 1994, p. 84)

""Dureau: So why did people want to assume the tasks of iama?

""Leoke: No. We didn't want it. We were afraid. The banara chose the iama.

""Dureau: Really? Is that why all the iama were captives?

""Leoke: Yes. We didn't want that task. We were afraid of leprosy and similar things [of the shrine]."" (Dureau, 1994, p. 84)

Hocart (1922, p. 285) makes a statement to the effect that priesthood could be hereditary, which seems to contradict the view that all iama were captives. However, Hocart does not use the word iama in this context, and it seems plausible that by ‘priest’ he is referring to the ‘senior lineage member’ who managed a shrine. 

There is no clear indication in the sources that the managers of shrines were as a rule bangara, though this seems possible. In any case, the bangara clearly played an important religious role. They sponsored headhunting raids, the motivations for which were in large part supernatural (to secure enemy skulls to offer to the ancestors, and to create malevolent ghosts that would weaken enemies):

""Enemy heads were necessary to inaugurate skull houses (tabuna), communal houses (paile, zelepade) or war canoes (qeto), on the death of banara and to release the widows of banara from confinement (Hocart, 1931: 303)."" (Dureau, 1994, p. 68) 

""While there seems little doubt that the more powerful banara did engage in raiding, through sponsorship even if not participation, the heads obtained were far more important in political legitimation, as visible signs of prowess, than as forms of wealth."" (Dureau, 1994, p. 69)

""Leoke's concluding point about tomate maza confirms that headhunting was motivated by a concern, not to acquire mana, but to create malign forces within enemies' communities. If a successful raid served to debilitate one's enemies through loss of population and wealth, a successful headhunting raid also had supernatural consequences in the creation of voracious endo-cannibalistic spirits. The tomate maza (literally, ‘beheaded spirit’) was one of an array of spirits, considered below, who had died untoward deaths. Marked by the style of death, they were left to haunt their own lands, inflicting anyone unfortunate enough to happen upon them, rather than becoming beneficient ancestors."" (Dureau, 1994, p. 73)

""The living fed and housed the dead, gave them offerings of shell rings and shell valuables. It was in this context, I would maintain, that Tinoni Simbo sought enemy skulls—as propitiatory offerings to their antecedents. The value of skulls, per se, lies in their being a particular manifestation of this practice of ancestral offerings. It is notable that the only Simbo shrines containing enemy skulls were those used to solicit ancestral blessing for raids or to give thanks for success … [78] … Enemy skulls were reserved for the place of warfare precisely because it was warfare they facilitated … For every skull displayed in a communal house or on an altar, a portion had been burned and given to the ancestors.""

‘Social regulations. Chiefs.’ (Codrington, 1891, pp. 46-58)

“Florida, and the parts of the Solomon Islands adjacent to it, afford an example of the division of the people into more than two exogamous kindreds. In Florida these divisions are six, [30] called kema, and each has its distinguishing name.” (Codrington, 1891, pp. 29-30)

“These divisions, kema, are not political divisions. It is not, as in the Banks' Islands where every house must needs contain members of both divisions, that every kema will be represented in every village, for one or two of the smaller may have no member there; but every man's wife, or wives, and all his children, must needs be of a kema different from his own, and every village must have its population mixed. The property of the members of each kema is intermixed with that of the others. In a considerable village the principal chief is the head of the kema which predominates there, and he exercises his authority over all, while the principal men of the less numerous kema are lesser chiefs. It is evident that the predominance of any kema cannot be permanent. A chiefs sons are none of them of his own kin; and, as will be shewn, he passes on what he can of his property and authority to them. If then in a certain district one kindred is now most numerous, in the next generation it. cannot be so, for the children of those now most numerous will be naturally many more in [34] number, and will none of them be of kin to their fathers.” (Codrington, 1891, pp. 33-34)

“IT has been shewn that the social structure in these Melanesian islands is not tribal, and it will have been observed therefore that there can be no political structure held together by the power of tribal chiefs ; but chiefs exist, and still have in most islands important place and power, though never perhaps so much importance in the native view as . they have in the eyes of European visitors, who carry with them the persuasion that savage people are always ruled by chiefs … [47] … A Florida Vunagi kept order in his place, ' directed the common operations and industries, represented his people with strangers, presided at sacrifices and led in war. He inflicted fines, and would order any one to be put to death.” (Codrington, 1891, pp. 46-47)

“The hereditary element is not absent in the succession of chiefs in other islands, though it is by no means so operative as it appears to be … [51] …The most conspicuous chief in Florida at the time and in the place in which Europeans became acquainted with that island was Takua of Boli, whose position it may be safely said was never so exalted in the eyes of the natives as in the eyes of their visitors. He was not a native' of Florida but of Mala, and his greatness rested in its origin on a victory in which as a young man he took a principal part, when a confederation of enemies attacked the people of Ta na ihu in Florida, where he was then staying. His reputation for mana or spiritual power, was then established; and from that, as a member of a powerful family of the Nggaombata, with his brothers Sauvui and Dikea, his [52] influence increased. Thus according to a native account of the matter ‘the origin of the power of chiefs, vunagi, lies entirely in the belief that they have communication with powerful ghosts, tindalo, and have that mana whereby they are able to bring the power of the tindalo to bear’. A chief would convey his knowledge of the way to approach and to use the power of the tindalo to his son, his nephew, or grandson, to whom also he bequeathed as far as he could his possessions. Thus he was able to pass on his power to a chosen successor among his relations, and a semblance of hereditary succession appeared. A man's position being in this way obtained, his own character and success enhanced it, weakness and failure lost it. Public opinion supported him in his claim for a general obedience, besides the dread universally felt of the tindalo power behind him.” (Codrington, 1891, pp. 52-53)

“The power of a chief naturally diminished in old age, from inactivity, parsimony, and loss of reputation ; and, to the credit of the people, also if, like Takua when he took the daughter of one who was already his wife, he did what was held by them to be wrong. In any case some one was ready, it might be by degrees, to take the place of one whose force was waning. A chief expecting his death prepared his son, nephew, or chosen [54] successor, by imparting to him his tindalo knowledge; but this could not always be done, or the choice made might not be acceptable. The people would then choose for themselves, and make over the dead chief's property to their chosen head. Sometimes a man would assert himself and claim to be chief, on the ground that the late chief had designated him, or because he had already a considerable following … or boldly standing forth and, crying out to the people that he was chief. Without a chief a village would be broken up.” (Codrington, 1891, pp. 53-54)",codrington1891[20-58]

At the time of Warren's fieldwork (1950), the Batak acknowledged a supreme leader and had done so for a 'long time', though Warren was unsure whether this state of affairs pre-dated 'Spanish contact':

""During the period of the writer’s stay in Palawan, the leader of all of the Batak in Palawan was an elder named Awa. He resided in the settlement named Sumurod, and his titular position was kapitan. The other Batak kapitan are leaders of the aggregates of bands only in the local areas in which they reside.

“The kapitan of the other settlements nominally receive their orders from Awa, and he tells these subordinate kapitan when to instruct their group members to go to the mountains, collect honey, plant, put out traps, and gather resins (bagtik) while others may remain in the community to plant, watch over the settlement, care for the children, etc ... [92] ... Interrogation of a number of informants revealed that a long time ago the political leader of the Batak was called tinente or kapitan. What the group leader was called, or whether there was such a position, previous to Spanish contact could not be ascertained."" (Warren, 1964, pp. 91-92)

Eder (1987, pp. 28-33, 'Settlement pattern and social organization') acknowledges that their may have been local headmen (presumably corresponding to Warren's 'subordinate kapitan'), but does not even mention the possibility of there having been a supreme leader of all the Batak:

“As with other bilaterally organized peoples in this part of the world, nuclear families are the basic Batak production and consumption units … At the close of the nineteenth century, approximately twenty to fifty Batak families were associated with each of the river valleys that composed their traditional territory. The inhabitants of each apparently saw themselves as some-[29] what different from the Batak of neighboring river valleys ... A headmanshiplike institution may have given some political expression to the feelings of social and cultural solidarity shared by residents of the valley.  Certain older men, by virtue of personality, emerge as natural leaders and become the focus of a residential aggregate.  The opinions of such individuals are respected but not binding; the others are free to argue or to leave (Estioko-Griffin and Griffin 1981: 98). The degree to which such leaders traditionally influenced the affairs of Batak in an entire river valley (rather than day-to-day residential clusters; see below) is unknown. Warren does speak of a Batak 'kapitan' for each river valley, but Batak political organization has been changed greatly by [30] extensive borrowings from the Tagbanua and incorporation into the modern Philippine political system (Warren 1964: 93-95).” (Eder, 1987, pp. 28-30)",warren1964[83-97];eder1987[28-33]

""The firstborn chief of the village, whether male or female, usually appointed one or more elders as advisors after discussions with influential villagers ...The elders managed intra-village and inter-village politico-jural affairs under the chiefs authority (as a couple) to maintain peace. Ideologically, all villagers including the siblings of a chief, were subject to control by the chief. Whatever announcement the chief made was expected to be enforced. In practice, however, an elder could exercise more power in political affairs, particularly so if he were trusted by the chief (see Kojima:32) ... Elders assumed leadership, mobilizing villagers for community enterprises such as building a new chief's house or repairing the chief's house. They put up shelves for heads, and made village roads, doing all sorts of tasks concerned with community feasts or farming for the chief's household. Usually the elder(s) collected tribute gifts for the chief and supervised the presentation of the gifts. If there were a dispute between villagers, they settled the dispute and negotiated compensation although the final decision was announced by the chief. The elder(s) took charge of actual leadership under male chiefs for communal headhunting or for large hunting expeditions, both organizing and directing the group of village men. In inter-village disputes over hunting grounds or in offenses resulting from headhunting, an elder was sent to the chief of aligned villages or to the village involved to find some procedure in reconciliation."" (Matzusawa, 1989, pp 206-207)

“…it is a fact that many Paiwan villages (particularly those in the western area) were jointly ruled by a single chief.  In a few cases, there were major differences or exceptions, such as: 1) one village including several chiefs, or 2) one chief ruling over several villages, or 3) one or two chiefs in a village controlling several other villages.” (Matsukawa pp. 214-215)","matsuzawa1989[63, 206-207, 214-215]"

The settlement pattern on Rennell was dispersed:

“The introduction of Christianity has recently caused a change in the type of settlement. As NORTHCOTE DECK has it: ‘The result has been a wonderful revolution in their social life. For whereas before, they lived scattered about in the bush, just one or two families together, so great has been their desire to be taught of God, that the whole population … has come together in about ten large villages’. Whether the good missionary’s enthusiasm is legitimate from an economic point of view is, perhaps, questionable, and in actual fact it is somewhat exaggerated. There are still but three or four villages with more than about 50 inhabitants such as Lavanggu, which is a quite modern creation due to the anchorage in Kanggava Bay … Other fairly large villages are Te Avamanggu in the western part of the island, Hutuna on the southern shore of the lake, and Tingoa at its eastern extremity. But in many cases people still live in small clusters of houses scattered over the island near the lake and along the fertile zone. The greatest number of dwellings originally observed by NORTHCOTE DECK in a single place was eight.” (Birket-Smith, 1969, p 45)

‘Chieftainships’ (Birket-Smith, 1969, pp. 38-41)

The island was divided into six more or less geographically defined 'chieftainships' or 'districts', one of which was considered 'superior':

""As previously mentioned the native name of Rennell is Munggava or ‘the large island’, in contradistinction to Munggiki, [39] ‘the small island’, also known as Bellona. Tradition tells us that originally both islands were ruled by a common chief who lived on Bellona, but sixteen or seventeen generations ago the [40] Bellona chief, Taupongi, was killed and his four sons separated. One of them, Manu, stayed on Bellona; another one, Sao-e-mangongena, was killed like his father and his people scattered, whereas Uaimango and Maitongo went to Rennell and settled at Lake Te Nggano. Up to the present day Te Nggano is considered the principal chieftainship, and its head occupies a position superior to that of the other chiefs of the island. Around Kanggava Bay, immediately west of Te Nggano, is the chieftainship of Te Mungginuku; it is also known as Te Manggavai, which is, however,more or less a nick-name. Then follows Banggikanggo, the principal settlement of which is Te Avamanggu, Te Tuakoi, and Taungganggoto with Hatanggoa as the main village, and farthest to the west Senggema, where the largest village is Kanggoa … LAMBERT has indicated the position of the chieftainships on a map, but as both the outlines of the island and the names are inaccurate, it is not very reliable. Moreover, the boundaries between the chieftainships are rather vague and do not follow definite lines."" (Birket-Smith, 1969, pp. 38-40)

'Intertribal relations' (Birket-Smith, 1969, pp. 116-117)

It is not clear whether the 'paramount' chief at Te Nggano had any direct authority over the other chiefs - the following suggests that the high chief was at best a 'primus inter pares':

""Bellona was the only island with which Rennell had regular intercourse, though not always of a peaceful character. The same is true of the districts on Rennell itself. LAMBERT emphasizes the jealousy between Te Nggano, the original population centre, and Te Mungginuku- or, as he calls it, Kolugu - around Kanggava Bay, which acquired added importance in modern times on account of the anchorage there, and says that it resulted in a war when the ancestors of that chief settled in the latter place three generations ago. It was quite evident, also when we visited the island, that relations were rather strained between the old high [117] chief, Taupongi, and Tahua, the chief of Te Mungginuku. As a rule, however, the three eastern districts, Te Nggano, Te Mungginuku, and Banggikanggo were allied against the westernmost ones, Taungganggotu and Senggema. Thus, for instance, was the state of affairs during the last war on the island. The central chieftainship, Te Tuakoi, was connected by family ties to both sides and joined sometimes one and sometimes the other of the fighting parties and enjoyed the doubtful privilege of being the habitual battle field."" (Birket-Smith, 1969, pp. 116-117)

On the other hand, Birket-Smith does describe the incumbent chief of Te Nggano as having been formerly the 'high chief of the whole island', and as having 'no little authority' in more recent times:

""For administrative purposes Rennell is divided into three districts, Te Nggano, Kanggava, and Te Manggihenua. Each district has a headman who is appointed by the Governmcnt with the common consent of the people and is paid a salary af £2 a month. During our sojourn the headmen were the three chiefs, Taupongi. Tahua, and Tigesua, but it must not necessarily be a chief. Both Taupongi and Tigesua were dignified old gentlemen, and Taupongi in particular, who was the old high chief of the whole island, possessed no little authority …  Tahua was somewhat younger and not very popular."" (Birket-Smith, 1969, p. 18)

The following description of chiefly powers pretty clearly describes the 'district chief' rather than the 'high chief'. 

""To some extent the chief possessed judicial power. If a man was wronged he might claim damages from the offender, or he might ask the chief for his assistance. The chief was entitled to have a breaker of the customary laws beaten or even put to death, or he might order his gardens to be destroyed. Blood revenge was common in case of murder. If, however, a murder was committed in the district of a friendly chief, the latter might approach the chief of the murderer and insist on compensation. Even marriages were subject to the approval of the chief, who in such cases laid claim to gifts. On the other hand the chief had no right to special shares of tile yield of horticulture and fishing. The most important of his privileges was, however, his right to impose taboo. Before the ripening of the crops. or if a ceremony demanding an abundance of food was forthcoming, he would make use of his power, but he might also abuse it in order to appropriate the belongings of his subjects.” (Birket-Smith, 1956, p. 44)","birket-smith1969[18, 38-55, 116-117]"

Sa’a had a number of hereditary ‘chiefs’, one of which appears to have had at least nominal supremacy. The role of the chiefs appears to have been largely limited to organizing feasts:

“The chiefs were not allowed to go to battle. The role of the war leader was left to others … The main social function of the chiefs was the provision of feasts … They exercised no form of government in our sense of the term, though they inflicted punishment or levied a fine for the infringement of the tabu which they placed on anything. The behaviour of the community was regulated by an intuitive sense of what was right and proper, by what Dr Rivers calls ‘group-sentiment’ … Any lapses from the accepted standards, e.g. adultery and marriage within prohibited degrees, or theft among commoners, was dealt with either by the persons concerned or by the community generally without any reference to the chief.” (Ivens, 1927, p 128)

‘Feasts; dances; gongs; pipes’: Ivens (1927, pp 160-177). 

Feasts appear to have been largely secular occasions aimed at prestige.

‘The priesthood at Sa’a’: Ivens (1927, pp 242-245)

“The officiating priest at Sa’a was called poro maa’i, holy man, at Ulawa poro ni mwane, with the same connotation … The title oraora was also used at Sa’a as a general name for priests, those in touch with the ghosts. At Ulawa the person who officiated at the offering of the first fruits of yams, whether a regular poro ni mwane or not, was known as poro e toora’i, the man who feeds (the ghosts). The person in each village on Ulawa, whose official duty it was to perform the ceremonial acts at the opening of the flying fish season, was known by two names … At Sa’a the priest was given the title pwäu ni mae, head of the fight. That this phrase is said to have been a summary in its description of priestly duty, is owing probably to the connexion of fighting with the practice of sacrifice to the li’oa [war spirits] when war was imminent, and also to the fact that the priest accompanied the fighters and took relics with him. The priest was also known as pwäu si henue, head of the village.” (Ivens, 1927, pp 242-243)

Regarding the relationship between chiefs and priests, all men had the right to sacrifice to their ancestors. The ancestors of the chiefs appear to have been among the most important deities (Ivens, 1927, p 180). However, Puu, who appears to have been more important still, was the served by commoner priests:

“The right to sacrifice to their forebears was inherent among the ruling chiefs … but from time to time was delegated to cadet members of their houses.” (Ivens, 1927, p 127)

“The chief priest for the local people was he who sacrificed to Puu. In all local rites this priest took precedence. Chief and priest ran in double harness. Each was the complement of the other. If anything, the priest by virtue of his close association with spiritual things was the leader … The priest spoke for the dead, and the chief was the root of the land, ine mauri, the living stock whence came life and fruition.” (Ivens, 1927, p 128)

“As stated above … the ghost at Sa’a whose worship predated that of the ghosts of the chiefly family was Puu. At his altar the offering of the first-fruits of land and sea was made.” (Ivens, 1927, p 179)

“Every man at Sa’a had the right to approach his ancestors in prayer and worship, and with the chiefs the special form of worship of their ancestors was the offering of a pig in sacrifice.” (Ivens, 1927, p 243)

“At Sa’a, then, every man who would sacrifice must first belong to, must own, the ghost, i.e. must be of his family … The case is the same with the priests of the commoners who officiated at the altar of Puu, and conducted the ceremonies in connexion with the first catching of bonito. Certain families of the commoners had the right to approach Puu, and the succession was from father to son or to sister’s son. The natural inference is that these families derived their descent from Puu. The original relic of Puu, his jawbone, had been replaced by a porpoise tooth from his ear pendant, which had touched the relic … In 1925 the last of the titular priests of Puu … disposed finally of the porpoise tooth in his position, the relic of Puu.” (Ivens, 1927, p 245)","ivens1972[109-129, 160-177, 242-245]"

18515,ulithi,86,3,150-3,"Ulithians lived in small, compact villages:

""The Ulithian village is a highly nucleated subunit of the wider community ... The average size of a village fluctuates over the years, but at the time of maximum population for the atoll the number of inhabitants for a village came to eighty-eight ... Except for the island of Falalp, where there are two villages, no island has more than one village. The Falalop villages are contiguous, however, and for many purposes may be regarded as a single unit with bonds of common interests."" (Lessa, 1966, pp 16-17). 

Each village was part of a district, led by a district chief. As these districts consisted of only one small village and one inhabited islet, it seems sensible to consider these districts to be extensions of the village rather than supra-village political units:

""Beyond the village, the next larger political unit is the district, of which there are eight in the atoll. The district is composed of a village and one or more lesser islands, most of them uninhabited but nevertheless economically useful.

""Each district, including some that are no longer inhabited, is headed by a chief. His jurisdiction does not extend over any village in his area but rather over the district as a whole."" (Lessa, 1966, p 32).

Although the entire atoll of Ulithi had a small enough population to be considered a local community itself, its geographical spread meant that its constituent islets were fairly isolated from one another, and thus could not function as one:

""Space resources are tiny, the atoll contrasting sharply with the immensity of the sea surrounding it ... At the same time its large size is a factor in making transportation and communication time-consuming and sometimes arduous, causing some islets to be relatively isolated from the others."" (Lessa, 1966, p 2).

The district, then, is the most appropriate unit to consider the local community. Above this, with leadership over the whole atoll, was the paramount chief:

""Ulithi is under the jurisdiction of a paramount chief, referred to in a loose way by Europeans as a king ... as executive head of the atoll he exists mostly to coordinate atoll-wide affairs and preserve interdistrict harmony."" (Lessa, 1966, pp 147-148)","lessa1950[16-17, 32, 147-148]"

‘Social organization and government’ (Ferdon, 1987, pp. 25-50)

""The Tongan population … was spread out over its island world in a pattern that was difficult to categorize. To better understand this situation it is first necessary to review what Mariner claimed were the three recognized geographic areas, or regions, of any Tongan island. These, at least in some cases, appear to have served as administrative districts as well. One of these was the hahake ... which was the name for the northern end of an island or, if its longer axis trended east and west, that end more toward the east. Its opposite was known as hihifo and was the southern end of an island or, if it trended east and west, the western end ... [12] The middle of an island, that is, the area between the two extremes but not necessarily the geographic midpoint, was called mu’a ... At least in historic times it was in this central district that the more important chiefs maintained houses for themselves as well as for a considerable number of their retinue. These houses appear to have been in addition to their dwelling complexes within the districts, or subdistricts, they controlled ... In terms of settlement patterns, the centrally located mu’a with its cluster of chiefly buildings and personnel could keep the cultural geographer from offhandedly classifying Tonga as having a universally dispersed pattern. Unfortunately, the only mu’a given any attention in the early accounts was that on the north coast of Tongatapu. At the time of Cook’s visits, it was the seat of government of all the Tongan islands and the home of the most sacred Tongan personage, the Tu’i Tonga. This assemblage, though open in nature because of each chief’s needs for fenced-in surroundings, gardens, and living quarters, was something more than just a handful of buildings. As Anderson described it, each of the chief’s enclosures included numerous buildings that, according to Vason, housed attendants, wives, and children. In addition, separating [13] each chief’s establishment from his or her neighbour was a public thoroughfare of varying width that some of the early Europeans insisted on calling a road. Thus, though open in plan, this assemblage of chiefly buildings with its interconnecting public pathways and, it would seem, a public mala’e, or grassy assembly area, could only be regarded as a true village, although essentially governmental in purpose. Although the mu’a of other islands may have been smaller by comparison, their assemblage must have been basically similar ... Except for the single governmental village in the mu’a of each of the more populated islands, the settlement pattern of the Tongan islands could properly have been called the dispersed type. However, even here there must have been a differentiation in the type of scattered dwelling units. This would have resulted from the fact that not only could the chiefly class own land, but those of the matāpule and mu’a as well, only the lowest, or tu’a, class being exempted. Thus, rank and status probably determined the amount of land owned by an individual, and that, in turn, determined the number of attendants required to maintain and cultivate the property ... Regardless, any chief of any status maintained a number of his retinue near his dwelling, as well as his workers, who would have included craft specialists among them. This required his country estate to contain sufficient dwellings, cookhouses, and storage units to maintain the entourage. Although these larger assemblages could hardly be called villages, or even hamlets, their makeup and content would seem to have been the Tongan equivalent of the eighteenth-century baronial type of plantation described by Glenn Trewartha for Virginia. It was undoubtedly [14] these building clusters that the Malaspina expedition referred to in their mention of villages on Vava’u, each with its own chief. From this more complex level the size and number of people and buildings per farm unit must have been on a declining scale, ending with scattered single dwellings on small plots of land."" (Ferdon, 1987, pp. 11-14)

""William Mariner’s summary, as published by Dr John Martin, seems to indicate that there were at least four basic classes of people. There was the ‘eiki, or chiefly, class, followed by individuals known as matapule, others known as mu’a, and at the bottom of the scale a group called tu’a ... [26] ... Until Mariner recorded his knowledge of Tongan culture, there was no information on the subject of what factors allowed an individual the right to be included in the ranks of the chiefly class. According to Mariner’s understanding, this governing class was made up of individuals related in varying degrees to either the presumed god personified having the title of Tu’i Tonga, another individual also of presumed divine origin named Veasi ... or what was then termed the Hau, or supreme secular chief. The last-named was a relatively new position of authority that, as will later be explained, may have come into being during the last quarter of the eighteenth century.” (Ferdon, 1987, pp 25-26)

“The political divisions of Tonga were never described as a whole by any of the primary European observers. As early as 1773, Cook concluded that the government was made up of a superior chief with others under him serving as district chiefs, and that there was at least one other level of chiefs below them. During Cook’s second visit in 1777, William Anderson noted that within Tongatapu alone there were more than thirty ‘districts, whose names he dutifully recorded ... Regarding these districts, Anderson further noted that each was ruled over by a chief and that some chiefs were more powerful than others. By 1797, James Wilson reported that the three recognized geographic areas of the island – that is, from west to east, hihifo, mu’a, and hahake – also constituted major governmental districts under the absolute control of individual chiefs. Each of these was subdivided into a series of smaller political divisions. These, in turn, were ruled by chiefs who, ‘in some cases,’ were account able to the chief of the major district of which they were a part. Why some were accountable to their superior chief and others were not was never explained. It may have had to do with comparative rank; for example, a subdivision chief who genealogically outranked his district chief may have been free of his control.

""Beyond Tongatapu proper, there are just enough scattered early references to suggest that this general pattern of chiefly control of land extended to other areas of Tonga as well. Thus, Franciso A. Maurelle referred to a chief who ruled over the forty-eight islands that make up the Ha’apai group, and years later Mariner described how Finau ‘Ululukalala assigned Tupouto’a to be chief of those islands. At the same time, there were other references to chiefs of individual islands within that group, which probably constited the equivalent of the subdivisions on the larger islands. Besides the sizeable islands of Vava’u and Eua, which had their own superior governing chiefs, such small islands as Atata, Pangaimotu, and Nukunuku were reported to have had individual chiefs, a situation probably holding for all of the smaller islands.” (Ferdon, 1987, p 28)","ferdon1987[11-16, 25-50]"

18518,manus-titan,86,2,150-2,"'The creation of leadership positions' (Gustafsson, 1992, pp. 51-97)

Gustaffson describes Titan villages as divided into ‘house groups’ (tali), each of which consisted of a large house (also called 'tali') and a number of subsidiary households (um). The tali was headed by a lapan, who lived in the dwelling of the same name:

""Earlier we said that the word tali is a Titan word meaning house, or family. The smaller houses occupied by a domestic community were referred to as um, while the large house where the lapan lived was referred to as tali."" (Gustafsson, 1987, p. 

""Each tali was organized along hierarchical lines, each family having their own rank. The high ranking families were the lapan and the low ranking ones were known as lau. Rank depended upon the family's relationship to the founder of the tali, and their relationship to the present lapan. The man holding the title of lapan, his sons, his brothers and his [Page 79] brother's sons, who were all the potential successors of the old lapan, were seen as high ranking families. Other families more remote in relationship to the founder and to the lapan were of low rank and could therefore not claim the title of lapan. With the lapan title followed certain privileges … Furthermore the lapan alone, with the consent of the spirits of the former lapans, had the authority to give permission to other members of the tali to use the alakeu [ceremonial platform] for distributions of wealth (p. 205) … A lapan inherited certain skills and knowledge from the ancestors, but he was not authorized to demand obedience from other members of the tali."" (Gustafsson, 1992, pp. 78-79)
77)

""A man was appointed to the lapan title; still he had to earn the confidence of other members of the tali, he had to gain a reputation for being a humble and generous man and a man to whom other members of the house community could come for advice … Apart from being a good listener and adviser, the most important task for a lapan was to organize ritual performances [Page 82] and the large-scale distributions of wealth that followed upon rituals … The lapan was not responsible for ensuring that other members of the house community succeeded in collecting enough wealth. His only responsibility was to organize the occasions when the distributions were to be made. (Gustafsson, 1992, pp. 81-82)

""A lapan, we said, did not have authority to demand obedience from other members of his tali and, if he constantly failed to support them he might, in the end, even if he did not formally lose his title, be replaced by another man who took over the responsibility of organizing the activities of the house community. Although a lapan was appointed to his position, this, as we have already seen, was not sufficient if he wanted to consolidate his position. Rights to leadership through succession served as a foundation only, and, in order to gain popular support, he would constantly have to prove himself in a way which resembles the strategy of a ‘Big Man’."" (Gustaffson, 1992, p. 82)

Within a village, each tali had certain functions. Whether or not lapan-ship is considered an office, these functions could be considered offices for groups if not individuals. The tali responsible for leadership in warfare was usually the dominant tali of the village:

""So far we have been discussing the organization of the tali, every village, however, was inhabited by several talis each of them represented by their own lapan. The different talis were hierarchically ranked in relation to each other, according to a particular area of knowledge, which each tali had made its own speciality. Every lapan was thus credited with [Page 84] certain knowledge of his own which he had received from his ancestors. One lapan, for example, was held to possess knowledge in organizing large scale fishing expeditions, while others possessed knowledge in such areas as organizing peace ceremonies, warfare or trading voyages. Every tali leader, thereby, had a special kind of knowledge of his own which, in spite of his affiliation to a particular tali, authorized him to organize intra-village activities. However not all activities were organized by these ‘experts’. If one house community, for example, was at war with another, it might not have obtained support from the lapan who was the expert on warfare, and instead be obliged to fight its own war. Equally, all the individual lapans organized activities, as for example fishing, for their own talis. It was only when the village as a whole was to carry out an enterprise on a larger scale, involving several house communities, that the lapan who possessed the special skill demanded for the occasion exercised his authority as leader. Should another man take over, then the project would be deemed to fail."" (Gustafsson, 1992, p. 84)

""In the traditional village organization, as we said earlier, every village was inhabited by several talis, and, in every village, one of these was always ranked higher than the others. This tali, at least among the Titan, is today the tali of peace, but in the old days, as it seems, it was the tali of war. The Australian administration when they appointed the luluais, usually did so with the consent of the villagers. In consequence it was often the leader of this tali, the highest ranked lapan in the village, who was appointed luluai. The tultul, as a rule, was a younger man belonging to one of the lapan families, who had been trained to succeed the luluai. A luluai thus, was often a tultul before he became a luluai. The new leadership, thereby, was transferred into the traditional organization, and the luluai came to function much like a traditional leader."" (Gustafsson, 1992, p. 100)",gustafsson1992[51-97]

“There was never actually one particular village named Sa’a … It was rather than Sa’a was the name of a district comprising certain hamlets, and these hamlets were spoken of under the one name. The hamlets were divided by the stream called Big River … On the north side were two hamlets, both of them a little way from the sea, and built on the side of the hill. The names of these two hamlets were Liu meumeu, Walk in fear, where the chiefs of the senior branch of the reigning house lived, and Purihaha, alongside which was the altar of Puu who was the chief ghost of the commoners. On the south side of the stream there was Mwenipue, where some of Puu’s descendants lived, and also the junior branch of the reigning house of chiefs, those descended from Halu. In addition there were several hamlets further south, and close to the beach … The hamlets were all open and unprotected, and had no fence of any sort round them … The sites were not permanent, and were vacated readily.” (Ivens, 1927, pp 28-29)

‘The priesthood at Sa’a’: Ivens (1927, pp 242-245)

“The officiating priest at Sa’a was called poro maa’i, holy man, at Ulawa poro ni mwane, with the same connotation … The title oraora was also used at Sa’a as a general name for priests, those in touch with the ghosts. At Ulawa the person who officiated at the offering of the first fruits of yams, whether a regular poro ni mwane or not, was known as poro e toora’i, the man who feeds (the ghosts). The person in each village on Ulawa, whose official duty it was to perform the ceremonial acts at the opening of the flying fish season, was known by two names … At Sa’a the priest was given the title pwäu ni mae, head of the fight. That this phrase is said to have been a summary in its description of priestly duty, is owing probably to the connexion of fighting with the practice of sacrifice to the li’oa [war spirits] when war was imminent, and also to the fact that the priest accompanied the fighters and took relics with him. The priest was also known as pwäu si henue, head of the village.” (Ivens, 1927, pp 242-243)","ivens1972[28-29, 242-245]"

18412,wogeo,84,2,149-2,"Wogeo was divided into ‘districts’, in turn divided into ‘villages’. Each village usually contained two ‘housing clusters’ consisting of mostly agnatic kinsmen, though the Wogeo themselves strongly downplayed the importance of the clusters:

""The natives divide the island into five districts with radial boundaries that follow such natural features as ridges and valleys … At the southeast corner is Wonevaro, and then, traveling in a clockwise direction, come Bagiau, Ga, Bukdi, and Takul. These are grouped into pairs that are traditionally on friendly terms; in addition, each district has a hostile relationship with two others. So Wonevaro collaborates with Bukdi and struggles with Bagiau and Takul, Bagiau collaborates with Takul and struggles with Ga and Wonevaro, and so on … Within each district the component villages are located close to the shore. Bukdi, with the hills descending as cliffs into the sea, is exceptional, and there the settlements—Gol, Bajor, and Kwablik—have had to be built a few hundred yards inland. The majority of the villages have between 60 and 70 inhabitants, though three are only half that size and two, Ga and Bariat, slightly larger."" (Hogbin, 1970, p 10)

The inhabitants of a village form a local unit, but each unit is split into two, and usually the halves are more important than the whole. (Hogbin, 1970, p. 18)

""The residents of a housing cluster are verbally distinguishable by reference to their headman, as, for instance, Marigum's or Bagasal's people in Dap or Kawang's or Janggara's people in Gol; but there is no single native term that can be applied to them. Further, in the popular view they do not form a group in the social sense at all. That they can be isolated on the ground, with dwellings in a separate corner of the village, is regarded as irrelevant, and I was repeatedly informed that they do not on that account have any special mutual claims or special reciprocal duties. What is supposed to be vital is not this small selection of relatives but the total of the cognates, all the men and all the women with whom a person has, or believes he has, genealogical ties."" (Hogbin, 1970, p. 21)

""Certainly it would be a grave mistake to underestimate the importance of the wide circle of cognates, but in the light of the foregoing discussion I have no hesitation in contradicting the statement that the households of the cluster do not form a social group. The truth is that they belong to a distinct and perpetual corporate entity, occupying their own territory, pooling labor, and owing allegiance to an hereditary leader. Unfortunately neither of the common terms, clan and lineage, is applicable. The criterion for membership is filiation—being the child of a particular parent, usually the father, occasionally the mother—and hence inheriting that parent's land rights. Cumulative filiation over the generations leads to the husbands in a cluster becoming a putative cognatic descent group, but as this condition is a by-product and not an essential, probably the expression should also be avoided. Thus there appears to be no alternative to the retention of my [Page 26] original phrase, the residents of the housing cluster, awkward and clumsy though it is."" (Hogbin, 1970, pp. 24-26)

Districts had no leaders, but each village had a pair of headmen. Each of the two ‘housing clusters’ that made up each village was effectively the following of one of the headmen, though the Wogeo do not seem to have seen the situation this way – as noted above, they did not see the housing cluster as a group with particular rights and obligations. Elsewhere, Hobin (1978) notes that the word for village is malal (p. 20), and that the headman, when not simply called kokwal, was called kokwal malal (‘headman of the village’) (p. 37). All this implies that Wogeo saw the headmen as village leaders, not cluster leaders. While this is a borderline case, village headmanship could be considered an office occupied by two incumbents. 

Religious role of the headmen:

""The office of headman (kokwal) depends on familiarity with a corpus of mythology, with the magical spells therein set out, and with the performance of a variety of ritual procedures. An old leader may transmit such information only to the eldest son of one of his wives, but, as he is likely to have several, there is almost always a number of young men eligible for the choice … Every village has a pair of headmen, each with a following of some of his close relatives."" (Hogbin, 1970, p 18)

""The political organization goes hand in hand with religion. The headman calls up the various monsters from the spirit world, and he alone owns the dance masks and flutes that bring them to life. His followers may wish to have a feast or an initiation ceremony arranged, but the final decision rests with him. His social position is also underlined by his right to order the playing of the flutes when events of importance take place in the village or in his household—perhaps the construction of a new club or the coming of age of his daughter—and by the heads of the neighboring clusters sending their flutes to offer sympathy if he is overtaken by illness or some other misfortune."" (Hogbin, 1970, p 189)

""In all the societies of Melanesia specialists own numbers of the magical systems concerned with major enterprises … The normal pattern of leadership for the region is by achievement rather than by ascription … Wogeo belongs to the minority of communities where headmen hold their position by virtue of birth. True, succession is not automatic, and an office holder must nominate his heir and sponsor him in a great ceremony … Whoever is selected then receives instruction in the entire corpus of the local specialist magical systems. Thus each Wogeo headman has a virtual monopoly within his residential cluster on the magic relating to group tasks and group wellbeing. If his unit is one that engages in overseas trade, then he performs the rites for a successful expedition; should the people agree that a raid is to be made on some other place, he casts the spells for victory; when a festival is proposed, he is responsible for the ceremonies before the communal garden is planted; at the festival itself he chants the nodding spells to preserve harmony; he is supposed to be familiar with sorcery to kill offenders and with inquest ritual to detect its use by others; and, perhaps most important in the eyes of his followers, they can look to him to bring sunny weather. Accordingly he manages the trading voyages, has charge of the warriors in an attack, regulates collective gardening, superintends festivals, controls the practices of sorcery and divination, and is believed to have the power of stopping the all-too-prevalent rain. It is scarcely a matter of surprise that he should enjoy high status and great prestige."" (Hogbin, 1970, pp 190-191)","hogbin1970[17-25, 189-191]"

The senior village men's house serves a combined administrative, military, and ritual center for the entire complex. Chieftainship is in principle hereditary within chiefly patrilineages, and heads of satellite settlements are likely to be paternal relatives of the 'tribal' chief. These chiefly lines do not, however, constitute a privileged aristocracy as among the Paiwan-Rukai farther south. [Mabuchi 1952, 1960, 1966).

18241,puyuma,86,2,150-2,"Tricky. Cauqueline says little about any supralocal authority, but indicates that it existed in the past at times among some Puyuma. 

The Puyuma were divided into two subgroups, Katipul and Puyuma proper (Cauqueline, 2004, p. 1). Katipul consisted of a number of villages (eight in the twentieth century), but it appears that Puyuma consisted of only one (Cauqueline, 2004, pp. 25-28). 

In the eighteenth century Pinadai, a man from Puyuma, proper was appointed governor over most of southern Taiwan. Many descendants of Pinadai became village chiefs, but it is not clear that any of them enjoyed the supralocal authority that he had.

""Leaving aside the mythological and legendary accounts and concentrating on history, Imperial Court hagiographers inform us that, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, a certain Pinadai, a man of the Raera household, settled in the village of Fangliao, located in the Kaohsiung and Chaoshan region … In the sixtieth year of emperor Kanghsi’s reign in the Ch’ing Manchu dynasty (1722), troubles fomented by Su Yi-kuei ﬂared up, and two of the instigators of these revolts, Wang Chong and Hsiang Chin-yi, took refuge in Taitung. The Emperor requested the help of Pinadai to capture these two outlaws. Immediately, Pinadai, whose reputation had already crossed the Puyuma boundaries, ordered each chief of the seventy-two surrounding aboriginal villages to catch the two fugitives. After their capture, the Emperor, very satisﬁed with Pinadai’s help, accorded him the title of ‘great king of Peinan’, and gave him the attributes of this rank: clothes, hats and shoes. The court also named him governor of the region extending from Sui Wei to Takang, i.e. from south of Hualien to Balangaw, in the suburbs of Taitung, and invested him with the power of levying taxes on all the peoples of the east coast: Amis, Paiwan and Rukai. 

“Regarding relations with the Paiwan, we can distinguish two different periods of Puyuma hegemony over this people: the ﬁrst narrated in the stories of Valikai and Taylor, and also mentioned by Mabuchi; and the second, later, period of Pinadai the ‘king of Peinan’. In Ferrell’s (1977: 92) Paiwan dictionary we ﬁnd the word ‘ kaderunan: tribute gifts formerly given to Puyuma chiefs yearly … and this term is also found among the Puyuma: Kadununan. Each year, at harvest time, the populations subject to the ‘great king of Peinan’ had to pay their tribute in rice, wine and pork. When the ‘great king of Peinan’ travelled in person to a region, all the inhabitants had to give him the best wines and the tastiest dishes. Each village was governed by a chief, a vassal of the ‘great King of Peinan’. Gradually, the villages were obliged to pay all the expenses of the extraordinary ceremonies performed in the family of the ‘great king of Peinan’. This is an example of the Imperial Court of China’s policy of ‘governing barbarians by barbarians’ and extortions similar [36] to those demanded by the ‘native chiefs’, tu si , from the populations of south China. An analysis of the consequences of this nomination is given in Figure 1.2, but, according to the Puyuma, a great many village chiefs have been elected from the Raera household since this period.” (Cauquelin, 2004, pp. 34-36)

In the late nineteenth century, most of southern Taiwan was allegedly ruled by a chief called Karitag or Takitok:

“Taylor (1885– 6: 195) writes a chapter about a group named the Tipuns. These are Puyuma from the village of Katipul, ‘those of Tipul’ … He notes that the Tipuns reign over the whole of the south, and mentions the name of their chief, Takitok, probably the famous Karitag.” (Cauquelin, 2004, p. 18)

According to another source, however:

“According to Mabuchi (1960), villages tend strongly towards local endogamy and political autonomy.” (Lebar, 1975, p 124)

Political organisation within the village:

“The age-system is at the heart of politics, since it is where men’s work is done. This role is particularly apparent in the relations linking it to another elementary division in society, that of the division of the village into moieties ... [147] ... We must also mention the existence of a village chief, even if his role is a secondary one. This personage does not belong to the age-set of Elders, he [148] is a ‘virile-warrior’; his status is not hereditary. According to the Puyuma, he was formerly chosen from the men of the founding household of the upper moiety, the founders of the community. According to eighteenth century historical chronicles, the Imperial Court nominated Pinadai, a Raera, ‘great king of Peinan’. His power, acquired from the Chinese administration, was strengthened by the Japanese, but, according to Fuijisaki (1928: 194), ‘The power of the chiefs is very limited’ – today his role is that of mayor in relation to the Taiwanese state, and he is always seconded by a civil servant ...The Elders did not transfer their powers to the chief, and his presence, apparently, did not change the various functions of the council of Elders; their power is pre-eminent, even though it is not a gerontocracy … Power is in the hands of the age-sets and the system moulds an egalitarian village society.” (Cauqueline, 2004, pp 146-148)",cauqueline-2004

For men dominate society, and only those men who have performed the highest sacrifice have full access to the spirit world of the ancestral ghosts around whose cult the ritual which takes place in the dancing-ground centres."" (Layard, 1942, pp 34-35). 

""The comparative simplicity of the Small Island Maki with regard to the number of ranks is, on the other hand, balanced by an immense increase in the number of rites, and by the great length of time they take to perform. This increase is seen also both in the quality and the quantity of tusked boars that are sacrificed, a number which on occasion rises to several hundred at a time. 	

""For, though only one 'line,' consisting of members of one matrilineal moiety within the patrilocal village, performs at one time, each member of this moiety is the son of a member of the other moiety, and family solidarity sees to it that both moieties combine to pool resources. In this way, the whole wealth of an entire village is contributed lavishly towards the performance of every detail of the rite. In spite of the number of years, roughly a generation, which it takes to perform the rite, each man whose life is not cut short has the opportunity of participating at least twice, or, if he is lucky, three or even four times. For it is a point of honour that the rite shall be carried through as speedily as possible, so that rise in rank may be swift and its performance by the opposing 'line' composed of members of the other matrilineal moiety (which in this patrilocal community at the same time includes the next generation) shall not be unduly delayed.""

“As far as can be learned, there never existed any large political units among the Subanuns, far less any union of the whole tribe. Perhaps the nearest approach to the formation of a large unit took place around forty years ago and appears to have been due to Spanish suggestion. At that time, according to the testimony of old headmen of the Sindagan region, an agent of the Spanish Government, Alejo Alvarez, set up a certain headman named Sumusa as the war chief of all the Subanuns around the bay. On the approach of a raiding party of Lanau Moros he had authority to summon all the Subanuns around the bay to resist them. After Sumusa’s death he was succeeded by a nephew, who in turn was followed by a chief now residing on the banks of the Peyo river. On the approach of a raiding party the war chief, who bore the ambitious title of ‘Lajah Gunum’ would send messengers to all the headmen of the region, bearing strips of rattan tied in knots whose number indicated the number of days which were to elapse before the date of the rendezvous, and all the chiefs, after concealing their valuable effects, would gather their young men together and present themselves at [62] the place appointed, which was ordinarily some easily defensible hill. Sometimes by the chief headman’s order, the women and children also would be gathered in the stronghold, at other times he would recommend that they conceal themselves in the mountains or stay at home, according to circumstances, but when the time of stress was passed, the war chief lost his paramount authority and became a mere local chief like the rest.

“This war chief controlled the largest number of Subanuns of any Subanun authority within my knowledge. He had under his orders, during the exercise of his special functions, perhaps some 3,500 or 4,000 persons, while the ordinary Subanun headman rarely had more than a few hundred. 
“It is proposed to write a few paragraphs regarding the rule of these ordinary headmen, having in mind throughout, as stated above, the conditions obtaining around Sindangan Bay.
“The headman was known as ti-mu-ai … The office ran in families, but did not ordinarily pass directly from father to son. It was more usual for it to pass from the late holder to his brother … He had practically no way of making his decisions respected but public opinion and the backing of his relatives, so that it was useless for a man to set himself up as a headman if the people did not want him. There was usually no formal election, but the ruling headman ordinarily associated with himself, in the exercise of his functions, the man whom he wished to succeed him, so that at the death of the older man the transition to the rule of the younger one was easy and natural. If the leading men, especially the elders of the region, vigorously objected, even the preference of the late headman was overruled, and some other man – almost always related to the late headman – was chosen. Before the coming of the American regime, the consent of the agent of the Spanish Government, Alejo Alvarez, is said to have been necessary, and still earlier, that of the princes of Sibugai of the houses of the Sultans of Magindanau. This consent, however, was usually a mere form, as the Spanish or Moro overlord cared little as to whole the headmen were, provided they paid the tribute.
“It will readily be inferred from the above that the power of the headman was quite limited … If he showed himself to be harsher in his punishments than the community believed was allowable under the unwritten but universally recognized law, namely, custom, he found his followers drifting away from him; this occurred by the simple process of their going into another district and placing themselves under the orders of another headman. It is, indeed, surprising that the headmen exerted as much authority as they did. It was due to the Subanun’s profound reverence for custom and his dislike of the alternative of obedience, namely, running [63] away from his kinsmen, that they could punish crime by levying fines, as they undoubtedly did.

“The headman was assisted by a number of men who acted as his lieutenants in outlying parts of the region under his jurisdiction and joined with him as assessors at the trial of important cases. These men were ordinarily elders esteemed for their good sense and knowledge of local custom, and were known as saililing (deputy), or masalag tau (big or important man) … The office of headman was no sinecure. Indeed, not a few Subanuns considered it to be more trouble than it was worth, and there was generally no eagerness to get it. He was held responsible by the Spanish agent Alvarex, and before him, by the Moro datus and princes, for the tributes of his locality, which he was expected to apportion among the ordinary Subanuns … Such services as the above, while probably the most irksome, were not the commonest. The headman’s routine duties consisted in the allaying of disputes, the settling of marriage portions and the trying of trespasses against the customary law. In most cases the Subanun authorities were given a free hand by their Moro overlords, and later, by the Spaniards.” (Christie, 1909, pp. 61-63)",christie1909[61-63]

18246,puyuma,84,2,149-2,"Cauqueline (2004, pp. 49-71) describes two types of ritual specialist - 'shamans' and 'bamboo diviners' (benabulu). Only the latter appear to have conducted rituals on behalf of the community, i.e. the village:

""The six founding households try, in each generation, to train a benabulu to maintain the ancestral cult house. The benabulu is above all in charge of the homeostasis of society and on this account performs all the rituals concerning the whole group: rain-making, offerings to the original ancestor, now a mountain, when the village is going through hard times, re-consecration of the tutelary ancestors (‘those who made the village’), setting up the ‘masters of the village gates’, offerings to the founding ancestors etc. At these times they work in a group."" (Cauquelin, 2004, p. 57)

""The individual reference lacking in the community rituals performed by the benabulu may be found in the shamanistic rituals performed by women. Their rituals deal with a precise, immediate problem. The relevance of the ritual is focused to such an extent on a temporary indisposition that a new ritual may be invented to solve a problem generated by contemporary life; for several decades now, shamans have been invoking the spirit of change ‘on account of all the upheavals our society has undergone’, as they say. Only the body of the invocation particularises the ritual."" (Cauquelin, 2004, p. 58)

Lebar describes a very different system, but with the same scale:

""The heads of chiefly families function at times as combined priest-chiefs with respect to larger ritual groups or entire villages (cf. Schroder 1967: 22). The position of chief (ajawan, ayawan) is in some instances, however, separate from that of priest (rahan, ragan.)"" (Lebar, 1975, p 126).",cauqueline-2004[49-71];lebar1975[126]

19019,maori,86,3,150-3,"The traditional view of Maori social structure is as follows:

“The smallest social unit is the biological family, which the Maori termed whanau, derived from whanau, to give birth. With each generation, the number of families increased and reached such numbers that the restricted term of whanau could no longer be applied to the group. The term hapu (pregnancy) was used to denote this expanded family group for it expressed the idea of birth from common ancestors and thus stressed the blood tie which united the families for the purpose of co-operation in active operations and in defence. If all went well, the hapu expanded still further in succeeding generations making it necessary for groups to separate from the original settlement and take up land in neighbouring localities. Thus the original hapu expanded into a number of hapu, but, as numbers were important in the frequent wars which took place, the hapu still recognized their common blood descent and united when occasion arose. The term iwi (bone) was brought into current use to include all the hapu descended from common ancestors and thus related to each other by a blood tie. To denote the groupings in English, the iwi has been termed tribe and the hapu a sub-tribe.

[334]

“Some sub-tribes remained restricted in numbers or even disappeared through ill fortune in war and other sub-tribes expanded so much that they assumed the status of a tribe and split into sub-tribes. Hence, the descendants of an original pair of ancestors became, in time, grouped into a number of tribes, each with its own sub-tribes. The connecting tie between sub-tribes was close and strong, and, though quarrels broke out between them, they were always ready to combine under tribal leadership for co-operation in tribal affairs. The tie between tribes descended from common ancestors was not so strong but it was recognized and served to bind them together loosely in a form of tribal federation. Such tribes often fought bitter wars between themselves but would unite against outside tribes for common defence or aggression. A similar sentiment would often unite tribes whose ancestors belonged to different families but who came in the same voyaging canoe. The claim for co-operation was the waka, or ancestral canoe, and an eloquent orator could arouse sentiment to the point of action.” (Buck, 1952, pp. 333-334)

However, in recent years the 'tribal' model of Maori society has been completely overturned. According to Ballara (1998), Maori in the eighteenth century lived in independent hapu, or 'communities' of hapu under a ruling chief that were always smaller than iwi. At least some of these clearly consisted of multiple local communities:

""Eighteenth-century iwi – then the widest social categories of Māori people who continued to acknowledge and sometimes utilise common origins – were of vastly differing population sizes and settlement patterns … At that time iwi did not function as political units. In terms of corporate function, such as the defence of their people or a common policy towards other groups, iwi were not operative units. Often, even usually, scattered in different locations, their people lived [125] in hapū and/or communities of several hapū which were often interspersed and intermarried with people of other iwi. Typically there was only tenuous, spasmodic and voluntary contact between the various descent groups which had ramified or branched off from the original founding ancestor of the iwi."" (Ballara, 1998, pp. 124-125)

""While hapū could at any time diverge from their community and act on their own, and while many hapū lived and worked separately at least part of the time, most small or minor 18th-century hapū resided with others in a complex relationship as part of a larger unit rather than as a single hapū. This unit was often a cluster of hapū living under the mana of a ruling chief. Such a unit is here called a community."" (Ballara, 1998, p 194)

“The basis of such a community was the mana of its chief over land and people … The mana of their chief was thought to ‘rest’ or ‘lie’ on or over his territory; this usually included his own ancestral lands, but also the lands and use-rights of the several hapu living ‘under’ his mana.” (Ballara, 1998, p 204)

""Many small, relatively short-lived communities were formed in time of danger … More complex and longer-lasting communities which remained together over generations in peace as well as war have been described elsewhere … Another such long-lasting community was on Motutawa island in the Rotokākahi lake and on surrounding lands south of Rotorua … [209] … Over a number of generations this community was dominated by the Tūhourangi people together with its major hapū, Ngāti Wāhiao … During the period that [210] is being discussed, Tūhourangi had other contemporary settlements centred around Te Wairoa (a village on the shore of the Tarawera lake, at Rotomahana, at Taumaihi and Okarerka, Parekarangi and Tumunui, and associated people living at Motuwhanake on the Waikto River and at Te Whakarewarewa … So Motutawa, which included several different pā on Motutawa itself, its various subsidiary kāinga around the shores of Rotokākahi and its cultivations and resource areas as far as Moerangi … was only one such settlement.""

The only religious figure described is the balian ('medicine man' or 'shaman'). Whether the balian occupied an 'office' is not entirely clear. On the one hand, they do seem to have had a core set of 'rights and duties':

“The principal duties performed by the medicine man may be divided into four kinds: acting as a medium, when he is in a trance-like condition and a spirit speaks through him; speaking to a spirit, when he speaks in his own proper voice to a spirit and receives an audible reply from it; offering up sacrifices and prayers at festivals of various kinds: and curing the sick. Only a few medicine men claim to be able to do all the above-mentioned things. The two functions that almost all of them perform are sacrificing at festivals and the treatment of the sick; a good many are capable of dancing themselves into a peculiar nervous state and acting as mediums; while those who claim the power to ‘interview’ a spirit and receive a reply audible to everyone present on the occasion are very few.” (Christie, 1909, p. 72)

“The presence of a medicine man is not necessary at a marriage ceremony, but it is said not be unusual for some priest present in the festive assemblage of friends who meets on such occasions to pronounce words of blessing on the couple, wishing them wealth and many children … On the other hand, there can be no doubt as to the leading role played by the medicine men at the special ceremonies, held from time to time in behalf of a whole community, to rid the region of some prevalent sickness, to protect it from an approaching epidemic of smallpox or cholera, or merely as an occasional prophylactic measure against disease in general.” (Christie, 1909, p. 82)

On the other hand, it is not clear that they had authority over a defined 'group' of people. Their sphere of influence appears to have depended on their personal characteristics rather than their occupancy of any particular office:

“The Subanun medicine man or woman is found in every neighbourhood; but the people distinguish between greater and lesser practitioners. The distinction is not based upon nor indicated by any outward difference. It depends solely on the man’s greater or lesser degree of supposed power over the unseen world ... The medicine man who gave this account of his ‘call’ was well known among his fellow-tribesmen for 50 kilometers along the coast, and was held in high repute."" (Christie, 1909, p. 71)

“On the approach of epidemics, which, to the Subanun mind, are caused by hostile spirits, the leading shamans of the region are consulted as to the cause of the wrath of the spirits and on the best way of appeasing it. The answer depends on the peculiarities of the individual practitioner, and varies from region to region, but certain things are always required by him, such as a cessation of merrymaking. No more gong playing is allowed, nor dancing nor journeys … Of course any such thing as marriage, with its accompanying gaiety, is absolutely tabooed, or to use the Subanun term, is li-ing.” (Christie, 1909, p. 83)

Frake (1957) describes Subanun families as being grouped into discrete 'communities', which in turn belonged to more vaguely defined 'regions'. Each 'community' appears to have acknowledged the expertise of one or more 'beliyan', but within the regions there simply seem to have been a number of 'prominent' beliyans who lacked authority over the region as such:

""The community is the maximal social group  to join together for scheduled agricultural offerings. Two annual offerings- [5]  always involve community-wide participation and a third often does. Since they require the consumption of large quantities of eggs, chickens, pork, and wine, it is customary for community members to alternate in providing specific items, each man making a different contribution each year. Every community generally has a beliyán , a person who is formally recognized as an expert in dealings with the supernatural."" (Frake, 1957, pp. 4-5)

""There are no regularly scheduled ceremonies which attract the region as a group though non-community members may be invited to important religious and secular rituals. Prominent mediums practice their skills throughout the region."" (Frake, 1957, p. 6)",christie1909[70-92];frake1957

Since they require the consumption of large quantities of eggs, chickens, pork, and wine, it is customary for community members to alternate in providing specific items, each man making a different contribution each year. Every community generally has a beliyán , a person who is formally recognized as an expert in dealings with the supernatural."" (Frake, 1957, pp. 4-5)

""There are no regularly scheduled ceremonies which attract the region as a group though non-community members may be invited to important religious and secular rituals. Prominent mediums practice their skills throughout the region."" (Frake, 1957, p. 6)

Lack of overlap between religion and politics:

""The shaman does not interfere in what may be called civil business. He does not count, by virtue of his office, as a headman, and his profession confers no rights to arrange marriage payments, settle disputes, and the like. There is nothing to prevent a headman from becoming a shaman if he wishes to, but the temperament requisite to the making of a successful medicine man is so different from that necessary to a headman that such a case must be unusual.""

Hence religious practitioners were not a special social category, and potentially any person could serve in any ritual role. Traditional ceremonies can be classified into two categories: life-cycle rituals and calendrical rituals. Generally speaking, the former continue to be practiced with an overlay of Christian features … [71] … By contrast, the traditional calendrical rituals have been abandoned with the demise of shifting cultivation … Whatever the type of ritual, the Bunun usually held them privately and did not go through complex processes. Even the major traditional agricultural ritual, the Mapulaho, was initiated by public shaman (Lisigadan lus-an) in his field without the presence of other members. After his performance, each domestic unit would choose a member to perform it privately.” (Huang, 1995, pp. 70-71)

“The political organization of the traditional Bunun is relatively simple … There were two political offices: the Lisigadan lus-an and the Lavian (Huang 1982: 332-4). The former was in charge of social order within the settlement. The Lisigidan lusan was a shaman whose duty was to direct all agricultural rituals … [75] … In addition, as a leader, he had to have the ability to mediate between quarrelling parties and resolve differences in the settlement.

'Geographic deixis' (Ellen, 2014, pp. 40-46)

Ellen stresses the autonomy of the Nuaulu clans, but a kind of supreme 'representative' of all Nuaulu also existed:

“In order to understand anything connected with ritual it is important to recognize the autonomy of the Nuaulu patrilineal clan and variations between clans in terms of demography, history and cultural practice. Indeed, in many ways, Nuaulu identity as a whole might most accurately be expressed as ‘a consensual federation of originally separate and autonomous groups’ (Valeri 2001 [1990a]:293). Throughout the period of my fieldwork there have been 12 Nuaulu clans (ipane or ipan; ‘soa’ in Ambonese Malay), all resident in the South Seram Area. At the time of my fieldwork in 1970-71, these were distributed between five main physical settlements …” (Ellen, 2014, p. 19)

“I shall have much to say regarding variation between clans in subsequent chapters, as we consider different categories of ritual … The reasons underlying different interpretation are various, from trivial cultural ‘drift’ to the ever-present tension between those Nuaulu who seek a unified settlement – perhaps even a raja of their own – and those who do not. However, the default position is the considerable autonomy that individual clans have, not only in matters regarding ritual (though particularly in regard to such matters), but in regard to other forms of social action and cultural practice as well … Each Nuaulu clan is a diarchy, ideally divided into two equal, reciprocally exchanging sections or ‘houses’, and Nuaulu religion can be summarily characterized as ancestor-worship focused on clan houses (numa). These latter are moiety-like groups based on descent and affiliation to either the numa onate (large or main house) or the numa kapitane (house of the war leader. The two houses are, therefore, simultaneously [23] complementary and hierarchic. The numa onate, alternatively called the numa maiane … takes precedence in ritual matters and is therefore senior, but only as a kind of primus inter pares … By contrast, numa kapitane is associated with the brothers of the wife and the brothers of the mother, who are outsiders to all ritual held in the numa maiane. The distinction between houses corresponds to an important distinction in Nuaulu kinship, namely that between the children of the brother and children of the sister.” (Ellen, 2014, pp. 21-22)

""Not only are there differences between clans in matters relating to physical orientation, but also between groups of clans in particular settlements, and between settlements. During the long period between approximately 1880 and 1980, when most Nuaulu clans were located around Sepa, the higher, mountainward settlement of Ahusuru embodied values of ancestrality and monne, while the lower, seaward settlement of Watane embodied the specific values of ancestrality associated with each kin group. This relationship was reflected in the roles of the ia onate Matoke-hanaie (the 'male' Matoke clan chief, primus inter pares of all clan ritual chiefs, located in Ahisuru), and the ia onate aia (the head of all [44] Nuaulu in matters relating to political interaction with the outside world, located in Watane)."" (Ellen, 2014, pp.  42-44)

All Nuaulu were of course subject to the Indonesian government:

""Except for the disturbances occasioned by the Second World War (1942-1945) and the Republik Maluku Selatan (RMS) period (approximately 1950-1966), the Pax Neerlandica, followed by the effective writ of the Sukarno and Soeharto administrations, froze the distribution of clans between 1882 and the late 1980s.""

“The priesthood, Taula-aitu … were divided into four classes, viz. priests of the war-gods, keepers of the war-gods, family priests, and prophets or sorcerers.

“1. The Taula-aitu-o-aitu tau (anchors of the priests of the war-gods) were important personages, being consulted upon all warlike occasions. This class invoked the assistance of various war-gods, but most of all Nafanua, a female deity who was reverenced by the entire population, and who in conjunction with Savea-se-u-leo may be considered the national gods of war. In [221] addition to these, however, each district had its own war-god.

“It was one of this class, the representative of Le Tamafainga, that usurped the regal power of the islands, and reigned with great tyranny over the whole of Samoa until the year 1829, when he was slain by the people of A’ana. He was worshipped as combining both regal and divine attributes. 
“2. O Tausi-aitu-tau (keepers of the war-gods) … next claim our attention. To their custody were committed the objects supposed to be inspired by the district war-gods … [222] … 3. O Taulā-aitu-o-ainga (anchors of gods of families, or priests of families) are the next class to be noticed. These summoned the aid of various gods … This office was sometimes held by the head of the family or his sister. If held by the former, it [223] gave him great power and authority over the different branches of his family, which he seldom failed to make use of in the acquisition of wealth … Some one of the aforementioned deities was selected by the family as the object of their veneration, and at certain times the god was supposed to enter into the Taulā-aitu, or priest, to answer inquiries or deliver demands … Perhaps the god worshipped by the family was Moso, and upon the announcement, ‘I am Moso, I am just arrived from the land of spirits to visit you,’ one of the elders of the party present answered, with much fear and reverence, ‘Approach; we are your subjects, and are here waiting to receive your commands,’ which address to the ghostly visitor was always made in the highest chief’s language. At the close of these introductory speeches the occasion of the visit was made known. Perhaps this was to utter a complaint of carelessness in bringing donations of food and property, accompanied with severe threats of vengeance if a liberal [224] supply was not speedily brought to his representative. Or perhaps the god’s anger was directed against some unfortunate who had been treasuring up a valuable mat, the existence of which had been known to the speaker and the possessor was threatened with quick punishment if the said mat were not immediately forthcoming … 4. O Taulā-aitu-vavalo-ma-fai-tu’i (anchors of the gods to predict and curse, or prophets and sorcerers) … This class of the priesthood invoked the assistance of the following aitu … and many others. Their services were sought after by persons who had been robbed or otherwise injured, and who sought to know the spot where the stolen articles were hidden, as also who was the thief, or the cause of the injury or curse that was supposed to have fallen upon them. They were also consulted by persons who sought to revenge themselves on others, and asked that curses might be uttered upon parties who were specially named. The sick were also taken to the Taulā-aitu, and they were consulted as to the occasion of all the sickness and probable issue, at the same time they were besought to invoke the aids of gods in the removal of the disease.

‘The political life of Samoa’ (Stair, 1897, pp. 83-102)

'Mythology and spirit-lore’ (Stair, 1897, pp. 210-241)

Religion and politics appear to have been fairly distinct in Samoa. 

According to Stair, Samoan society consisted of five 'classes' (Stair, 1897, pp. 65-75): Alii ('chiefs'), Taulāaitu ('priests'), Tulafale ('orators'), Faleupolu (something like 'bourgeosie'), and Tangatu-nuu ('commoners'). In theory these groups were ranked in descending order of status, but in actuality the status of the first four classes appears to have been similar. 

“The population was divided into five classes, viz. – Alii, Taulāaitu, Tulafale, Faleupolu, and Tangata-nuu. Comprised in these classes are others, as – Songa, Soa, taumasina, Atamai-o-alii, and Salelisi, who were all attendants of chiefs, and privileged persons.

“The Alii, or chiefs, constitute the highest class, and are of various ranks and authority, but the latter is often slight ..."" (Stair, 1897, pp. 65)

“The Taulā aitu, ‘anchors of the spirits,’ from taula, ‘an anchor,’ and Aitu, ‘spirit’, formed the priesthood, and possessed great influence over the minds of the people … The Tulafale were a very powerful and influential class, the real authority and control of districts being frequently centred in them. They were the principal advisers of the chiefs; the orators were usually selected from their number; the Ao, or titles of districts, were always in their gift; and they had the power, which at times they did not scruple to use, of deposing and banishing an obnoxious chief. They were generally large land-holders, and, in some places, as at Leulumoenga, they comprise the leading families, and have the entire control of the settlement.” (Stair, 1897, p. 70)

“The Fale Upolu (house of Upolu) are the next in rank and importance. They are also considerable land-owners, and possess much influence. They supply the chiefs with food, receiving from them native property in return, which payment is called Tōnga, and consists of mats, siapo, or canoes … Individuals of this class sometimes take part in the discussions of their public assemblies, and in a variety of ways make their influence felt.

“The class called Tangatā nu’u (or men of the land) are a useful class, although in some sense looked down upon. Their employments are varied: bearing arms in time of war, or cultivating the soil, fishing, and cooking, in time of peace. In the distant past their lot was often a hard one, and they smarted under the tyranny of their masters, but of late years things have changed, and their position has been greatly ameliorate."" (Stair, 1897, p. 74).

Political authority was largely in the hands of the 'fono' (council), which was dominated by the Tulafale but also included Alii and Faleupolu. 

“The local affairs of each settlement were under its immediate control, and were discussed and decided upon in a public assembly composed of the leading men of each village or district. More weighty matters, such as declaring war or making peace, the appointment and installation of chiefs, or indeed any matters of general importance to the whole district, were deliberated upon in a general fono, or parliament of the whole district, composed of representatives of all the different settlements and villages of the district. Each district had a leading settlement called its Laumua.

“It was the province of the Laumua to convene the fono, or general assembly of its respective districts, to a announce the object for which it had been summoned, to preside over its deliberations, to arrange disputed or knotty points, as well as to sum up the proceedings and dismiss the assembly; in fact, to sustain the office of chairman. chairman … The speakers might be either chiefs, Tulafale, or Faleupolu; the former occasionally addressing a fono, but usually the class called Tulafale were the principal speakers. Each chief had [85] generally a Tulafale, who acted as his mouthpiece; and each settlement had its Tulafale sili, who was the leading orator of the district.” (Stair, 1897, pp. 84-85)

It is not clear that the Alii, Tulafale or Faleupolu classes had any religious authority. High-ranking Alii were considered sacred, but Stair emphasises that they were not priests:

“The sacredness attributed to many chiefs of high rank gave rise to observances which were irksome to their families and dependants, since whatever they came in contact with required to undergo the ceremony of lulu’u, or sprinkling with a particular king of coconut water … both to remove the sanctity supposed to be communicated to the article or place that had touched the chief, and also to counteract the danger of speedy death, which was believed to be imminent to any person who might touch the sacred chief, or anything that he had touched; so great was [128] the mantle of sancity thrown around these chiefs, although unconnected with the priesthood.” (Stair, 1897, pp. 127-128)

Religious authority was held by various 'priests'. These priests do not as a rule seem to have held political office, though 'family' priests might also be family heads. 

“The priesthood, Taula-aitu … were divided into four classes, viz. priests of the war-gods, keepers of the war-gods, family priests, and prophets or sorcerers.

“1. The Taula-aitu-o-aitu tau (anchors of the priests of the war-gods) were important personages, being consulted upon all warlike occasions. This class invoked the assistance of various war-gods, but most of all Nafanua, a female deity who was reverenced by the entire population, and who in conjunction with Savea-se-u-leo may be considered the national gods of war. In [221] addition to these, however, each district had its own war-god.

“It was one of this class, the representative of Le Tamafainga, that usurped the regal power of the islands, and reigned with great tyranny over the whole of Samoa until the year 1829, when he was slain by the people of A’ana. He was worshipped as combining both regal and divine attributes. 

“2. O Tausi-aitu-tau (keepers of the war-gods) … next claim our attention. To their custody were committed the objects supposed to be inspired by the district war-gods … [222] … 3. O Taulā-aitu-o-ainga (anchors of gods of families, or priests of families) are the next class to be noticed.

At the close of these introductory speeches the occasion of the visit was made known. Perhaps this was to utter a complaint of carelessness in bringing donations of food and property, accompanied with severe threats of vengeance if a liberal [224] supply was not speedily brought to his representative. Or perhaps the god’s anger was directed against some unfortunate who had been treasuring up a valuable mat, the existence of which had been known to the speaker and the possessor was threatened with quick punishment if the said mat were not immediately forthcoming … 4.

The sick were also taken to the Taulā-aitu, and they were consulted as to the occasion of all the sickness and probable issue, at the same time they were besought to invoke the aids of gods in the removal of the disease. In return for these services they received large presents of food and valuable property.” (Stair, 1897, pp. 220-225)

All of Samoa at times had a 'king', though it is not clear that this figure had any political functions. The king who reigned most recently in Samoa prior to the arrival of the missionaries was also a priest, though this seems to have been anomalous:

“Upon the death of Safe-o-fafine, the last king in the line of Muangututī’a, the title remained vacant for a considerable time, but was at length usurped by a taulāaitu, or war-priest of Manono, named O le Tamafainga, who not only assumed the attributes of king, but also those of a god. He was a tyrant, and from his being worshipped as a god his authority was great. Although this was keenly felt and smarted under, in the hope of, in some measure, escaping from his tyranny the people of A’ana were led to confer the title of Tui A’ana upon him; but they soon found out the mistake that they had made, as his rule became more oppressive and his tyranny worse. The remaining titles were, however, soon obtained, and he was proclaimed O le Tupu-o-Samoa, and thus for the first time for many generations this dignity passed from the family which [78] had so long held it … He did not long enjoy his honour, for as his tyranny increased so did the hatred of the people of A’ana, until at length his conduct became so hateful that they rose against him, and killed him in the year 1829, just before John Williams visited Samoa for the fist time."" (Stair, 1897, pp. 77-78)

Another comment on religion and politics in Samoa:

""The political system of titles and councils was largely independent of religion ... Indeed, what links existed between political and religious organization in Samoa indicate the dependence of religion upon politics, rather than vice versa as was characteristic of Tahiti (Keesing 1934a: 399-400)"".

Each chief had [85] generally a Tulafale, who acted as his mouthpiece; and each settlement had its Tulafale sili, who was the leading orator of the district.” (Stair, 1897, pp. 83-85)",stair1897[83-102]

18411,wogeo,86,2,150-2,"Wogeo was divided into ‘districts’, in turn divided into ‘villages’. Each village usually contained two ‘housing clusters’ consisting of mostly agnatic kinsmen, though the Wogeo themselves strongly downplayed the importance of the clusters:

""The natives divide the island into five districts with radial boundaries that follow such natural features as ridges and valleys … At the southeast corner is Wonevaro, and then, traveling in a clockwise direction, come Bagiau, Ga, Bukdi, and Takul. These are grouped into pairs that are traditionally on friendly terms; in addition, each district has a hostile relationship with two others. So Wonevaro collaborates with Bukdi and struggles with Bagiau and Takul, Bagiau collaborates with Takul and struggles with Ga and Wonevaro, and so on … Within each district the component villages are located close to the shore. Bukdi, with the hills descending as cliffs into the sea, is exceptional, and there the settlements—Gol, Bajor, and Kwablik—have had to be built a few hundred yards inland. The majority of the villages have between 60 and 70 inhabitants, though three are only half that size and two, Ga and Bariat, slightly larger."" (Hogbin, 1970, p 10)

""The inhabitants of a village form a local unit, but each unit is split into two, and usually the halves are more important than the whole."" (Hogbin, 1970, p. 18)

""The residents of a housing cluster are verbally distinguishable by reference to their headman, as, for instance, Marigum's or Bagasal's people in Dap or Kawang's or Janggara's people in Gol; but there is no single native term that can be applied to them. Further, in the popular view they do not form a group in the social sense at all. That they can be isolated on the ground, with dwellings in a separate corner of the village, is regarded as irrelevant, and I was repeatedly informed that they do not on that account have any special mutual claims or special reciprocal duties. What is supposed to be vital is not this small selection of relatives but the total of the cognates, all the men and all the women with whom a person has, or believes he has, genealogical ties."" (Hogbin, 1970, p. 21)

""Certainly it would be a grave mistake to underestimate the importance of the wide circle of cognates, but in the light of the foregoing discussion I have no hesitation in contradicting the statement that the households of the cluster do not form a social group. The truth is that they belong to a distinct and perpetual corporate entity, occupying their own territory, pooling labor, and owing allegiance to an hereditary leader. Unfortunately neither of the common terms, clan and lineage, is applicable. The criterion for membership is filiation—being the child of a particular parent, usually the father, occasionally the mother—and hence inheriting that parent's land rights. Cumulative filiation over the generations leads to the husbands in a cluster becoming a putative cognatic descent group, but as this condition is a by-product and not an essential, probably the expression should also be avoided. Thus there appears to be no alternative to the retention of my [Page 26] original phrase, the residents of the housing cluster, awkward and clumsy though it is."" (Hogbin, 1970, pp. 24-26)

Districts had no leaders, but each village had a pair of headmen. Each of the two ‘housing clusters’ that made up each village was effectively the following of one of the headmen, though the Wogeo do not seem to have seen the situation this way – as noted above, they did not see the housing cluster as a group with particular rights and obligations. Elsewhere, Hobin (1978) notes that the word for village is malal (p. 20), and that the headman, when not simply called kokwal, was called kokwal malal (‘headman of the village’) (p. 37). All this implies that Wogeo saw the headmen as village leaders, not cluster leaders. While this is a borderline case, village headmanship could be considered an office occupied by two incumbents.",hogbin1970[17-25]

‘Hena Manusa: Seven positions, seven nuru’ (pp. 138-149)

The Alune lived in semi-autonomous territories called hena (domains). One of these hena, Manusa, is described in detail in the source (Boulan-Smit, 1998).

In the twentieth century hena populations were consolidated into nucleated villages, but previously they appear to have consisted of several settlements. Manusa, which had an area of 181 sq. km (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 12), consisted of several ‘hamlets’ (p 169), which were not tightly clustered (Fig. 6.1). 

Governance of the hena was vested in the hena upui (‘grandfathers of the domain’). Boulan-Smit (1998, pp. 138-149) describes seven offices:

""Seven is also the number of functions and duties which order the ancient social [138] organisation of the hena to make it a complete body. These are the positions/duties (tugas) of hena upui grandfathers / ancestors of the hena'. At the present time, the seven hena upui are recalled as follows: Latu ela mena: ('Great lord in the front'), the leader/ruler/head, upu tapele: the lord of the land, maeta'e: the ritual performer, ama lesi: the warlord, ama nili: the saniri elder, peace negotiator, alamanane: the spokesman, and ama tita: the liaison agent … Let us  examine these functions more closely."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, pp. 137-138)

The offices of Latu ela mena, upu tapele, and maeta’e appear to have been the most important, since they were associated with the ‘three latu [lords]’ of the domain:

""Everybody in Manusa agrees that the three functions of leader, lord of the land and ritual performer were filled by the three latu."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 138)

The Latu ela mena ('leader') appears to have been the nominal leader of the domain. His role is somewhat obscure – in Manusa, where Boulan-Smit conducted her fieldwork, the office had long been unfilled. 

""Everybody in Manusa agrees that the three functions of leader, lord of the land and ritual performer were filled by the three latu. However, in the narrative the first leader, Latuelamena, left at the foundation of the domain. Some elders support the case that he was immediately replaced by the warlord, others that his powerless representative (Tibali, nicknamed ana sosi 'the ignorant child') filled his empty seat while his function was assumed by others. This is where tradition and official history are interwoven. No one remembers [139] who (other than Latuelamena) led Manusa before 1920, when colonial interference started to be felt and was documented."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, pp. 138-139)

The upu tapele ('lord of the land') was an authority on 'customary law and land tenure' within the hena, as well as having 'privileged contact with the ancestors of the hena':

""In Manusa, the 'lord of the land' (upu tapele) is indeed knowledgeable and regarded as the one to whom to refer on matters of customary law and land tenure as long as they concern the 'land' (tapele) and the 'custom' (atate) within the hena itself. The upu tapele is the descendant of the founding ancestor of the domain. Because of this ancestry he has a privileged contact with the ancestors of the hena … However an upu is the lord, the custodian, the guardian, the person having duties and responsibilities toward something, but not its owner."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 140)

The maeta'e ('ritual performer') 'collected offerings' for domain-wide rituals and was also an officiant of the Kakehan (a ritual 'brotherhood'):

""The ritual performer collected the offerings of all the nuru for their common ritual centre on Nuruitu. He was also the ritual officiant of the Kakehan ('a'ehane) in the 'men's house' (luma tutue) before the prohibition of initiation and men's rituals in the 1920s, when the village officially converted to Christianity."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 142)

The ama lesi appears to have been some kind of shaman as well as a warlord:

""Van Wouden attributed to the malesi the role of a 'champion' but also the duties of a diviner or an astrologer, an activity he did not investigate further. Shamanism was a common practice among Alune elders before the conversion to Christianity. The shamanic aspect of the amalesi's charge applied in matters which concerned his field of specialisation i.e. warfare, head hunting, the movements of the group (he led migrations), protection or extension of the boundaries, and men's activities related to the forest."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 142)

The ama nili headed the domain council and represented the domain on larger councils. This role may have been a new (postcolonial?) introduction:

""The function I call peace negotiator is ama nili: 'saniri father'. In peace time, his role was to head the 'village council of elders' (nili) and to act as the representative of the hena in the larger saniri (nili ela) of the river batai. As head of the elders' council he was expected to be [144] knowledgeable in customary matters, more specifically in what concerned the administrative relationship with the outside, including land boundaries … For some village elders, the function is regarded as a 'new' one."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, pp. 143-144)

The roles of alamanane and the ama tita (‘left hand’ and ‘right hand’) were clearly subsidiary. The former assisted the maeta’e (Boulan-Smit, 1998, pp. 145-146), and the latter assisted the village council (p. 146). 

Beyond the hena, Boulan-Smit also describes a coalition of hena within the Sapalewa River Valley, Kwele Batai, which was represented in the larger system of 'nili' councils (described below). This appears coalition appears to have been the largest political unit situated wholly within the Alune ethnolinguistic group.

“Inland, west of the Sapalewa, was the independent coalition of the nili Kwele Batai, the Saniri of the Trunk of the Large River. It brought together the Alune mountain settlements of Rumasoal (sarimeten of Sapalewa), Riring (anakota of Sapalewa) with those of Niniari, Murikau and Lumoli, three mountain villages of the upper Eti river. This mountain/indigenous coalition had its own representatives in the large Saniri. It counterbalanced the coastal powers of Kaibobo (Eti) and Lisabata (Sapalewa), two former Muslim vassals of the Ternatan governor of Luhu in Huamual.” (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 79)

Every Alune hena appears to have been affiliated with one of three 'batai' - territorial units corresponding to river valleys. Each of the three batai was multi-ethnic. All three included 'coastal Muslims', and two also included Wemale. Each batai was centred on a 'coastal Muslim' town that had nominal precedence in periodic 'assemblies' (nili). The three batai were united in a 'regional' federation called Wele Batai Telu which also held assemblies, but appears to have had no 'centre':

""West Seram was a densely forested area at the periphery of a large trading operation controlled by the northern Sultanates and later by the VOC. Ternate had a Gubemur in Huamual and several vassal settlements on the south and north coasts. The interior was occupied by small rival groups, scattered along the valleys of the main rivers. Small scale warfare and head-hunting was current both in the mountains and at the coast, and everybody lived in mutual suspicion. Yet exchanges were vital and alliances, even temporary ones, were indispensable. Periodic assemblies of the elders, called nili, facilitated the relationships between various units. This widespread institution, which assembled the elders in each domain, also met at river and regional level. Although every small unit remained fiercely independent, these councils maintained some communication and coordination between the various coastal and mountain groups of the region. The oral tradition confirms the ancient existence of these nili assemblies in west Seram. They gathered the representatives of small and large units at the level of domains (nili hena), river valley (nili ela) or region (nili 'wele batai telu or saniri hutu). (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p 72)

""The nili was primarily an assembly where conflicts between domains were brought for arbitration. The parties in conflict were helped to reach an agreement which was witnessed by the representatives of the whole region. The assembly acted as peace keeper and negotiation facilitator for various matters related to secular power. The core group of the assembly, the niliwei, the 'source/base' of the Saniri, arbitrated these large conciliatory coastal meetings. The nili of a river was the point of convergence for mountain and coastal groups of the same valley to meet, interact and debate, reinforcing regional cohesion … When they are greeted in front of the whole assembly, the domains are positioned within the batai in a precedence ordered from coast to mountain … In each batai the senior representative was a powerful coastal Muslim domain allied to Ternate. This coastal centre (the inama latu), was the niliwei the 'core', the 'base', 'the source of continuity' of the nili of its river and, as such, was given ultimate precedence. (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 83)

“The Alune population living in the valley of the Eti river in the south west belongs to the Eti batai. In the south-east, several groups of Wemale and Alune people share the Tala batai. In the north the Alune living in the valley of the Sapalewa belong to the Sapalewa batai. When large meetings (nili ela) were held, the Wemale of the north eastern Uli river batai joined with the Sapalewa batai.” (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 101)

NOTE: The following makes it clear that the Muslim coastal villages were not Alune:

""Alune and Wemale are Reformed Christians (GPM) while the coastal population is predominantly Muslim with a minority of different Christian affiliations."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p 10)","boulan-smit-1998[10, 71-79, 137-149, 169, 174]"

The sorcerer could summon the spirits whenever he liked. Inside his house would be found a wooden bowl, into which he put food for the spirits every day. Thus the spirits were thought to congregate more or less in the vicinity of this wooden bowl. The living not only feared the spirits but also this bowl and the food that was in it. The sorcerer was also held to have the power to inflict illness on the living, irrespective of which tali [clan] they belonged to.

Religious authority in Laboya appears to have been vested in groups (kabihu and Uma) rather than individuals, but it was exercised by religious practioners called rato. Various kabihu and Uma played specific roles in the Pan-Laboyan paδu and nyale ceremonies. No one group predominated, and there was a considerable 'turnover' of which group occupied which role. The Kabihu 'Modo', who played an important (though not supreme) role in the ceremonies, was recognised as the 'Lord of the Land' throughout Laboya and had certain religious prerogatives.

""Paδu and Nyale are the names of the two main yearly rituals which punctuate the Laboya agricultural cycle, their social and ceremonial life ... Paδu is held at the end of the dry season, in October for Laboya proper and in November for Patyala ... Both Laboya proper and Patyala celebrate Nyale together in February, at the height of the rainy season, ideally just before the planting of the rice seasons ... Paδu is the most important yearly ceremony for for mountain people, such as Lolinese, whereas Nyale festivities are the prerogative of coastal communities such as Kodi and Wanokaka ... Paδu is not entirely absent from the ritual cycle of the Kodinese or of the inhabitants of Wanukaka but to them this ritual plays a subsidary role ... [12] ... Apparently, location determines which of the two ceremonies is the most important. The Laboya, however, consider themselves an exception, a state confirmed by the sayings of all other West Sumbanese. The Laboya, following the instructions of the ancestors, hold both ceremonies because as they say, you cannot have Paδu without Nyale and vice versa ... The Laboya take considerable pride in the fact that they alone are entitled to celebrate both Paδu and Nyale. The underlying idea is that being blessed by the ancestors, they contribute most to the spiritual and material needs of all West Sumbanese."" (Geirnaert, 1992, pp. 11-12)

""Under the name of Ubu Jara (Lord Horse), Ubu Raba became the ancestor of kabihu Modo and Ubu Jara's original loom, heddle stick, shed rod and sword are kept among the sacred heirlooms in the ancestral house of kabihu Modo right up to this day. Like Ubu Jara, kabihu Modo is the Mori Tana, Ind. Tuan Tanah, the 'Lord of the Land,' the 'Owner of the Earth' of Laboya. Whenever one digs a hole on a new plot of land, one has to inform kabihu Modo and give their [37] religious practitioner (rato) a chicken, betel and areca nut so that he may proceeed and make offerings to the spirit of Ubu Jara."" (Geirnaert-Martin, 1992, pp. 36-37)

""Hodana is the village where the first ancestors of Laboya settled after their long migration from camp Sasar. Ubu Raba, who often took the shape of a python and who became later an ancestor of kabihu Modo ... invited all people to come to Hodana. To insure the arrival of the rains and to organize farming, Ubab Raba and other elders ... decided to organize and perform Pa?u and Nyale for which each kabihu was assigned a ritual task. The assignment of ritual tasks to each kabihu during Pa?u and Nyale constitutes the foundation of Laboya society."" (Geirnaert-Martin, 1992, p 138). 

“Geographically and ritually, Hodana is the centre of Laboya, from where all kabihu of Laboya proper and of Patyala have originated. Ideally, all of them are supposed to have their ancestral house in Hodana. In practice, several kabihu, for example Welowa, Ubumaleha and Kadengara, have established their own ancestral villages elsewhere long ago … [145] … The site where an ancestral house should stand is supposed to correspond to the one appointed by Ubu Raba, Ubu Rehi, Anamalangta Bawe and other apical ancestors. At the time when they organized Pa?u and Nyale, the ancestors assigned specific tasks in the yearly rituals to each kabihu and Uma and this arrangement is presented as immutable. In accordance with their ceremonial role during Paδu and Nyale, the kabihu were given a special place on which to build their first house. Therefore, the geographical mapping of Hodana corresponds to a ritually significant social division.” (Geirnaert, 1992, pp. 144-145)

""Next to these five categories of people, exists another group of people called the rato who are part-time religious practitioners. Unlike the former, the latter is determined by patrilineal descent. Ideally a rato is a direct descendant of an uma's [house's] founding ancestor ...In the ancestral villages of Hodana, Motodawu and Malihu, a rato is in charge of the ritual tasks assigned by the first ancestors to his Uma for the celebration of pa?u and Nyale ...Rato are supposed to lead exemplary lives ... I was told that, in the past, they were also not allowed to take part in head-hunting raids. Perhaps the rato formed a relatively neutral category with mediatory skills ...  It seems that rato were in charge of religious affairs whereas the ata pote [rich men] took care of the increase of the wealth and renown of their Uma, a division found in other parts of Indonesia as well.""

‘Social morphology: Kinship and marriage rules’ (Geirnaert-Martin, 1992, pp. 193-227)

Difficult to code this, as the Laboya were under foreign rule during the time focus and had been for some time. Prior to Dutch control, the Laboya appear to have had no political authority beyond the 'clan'. A 'raja' for all of Laboya was appointed by the Dutch, but this position (and Laboya as an administrative entity) apparently disappeared under Indonesian rule:

“Into the political organization of each suku, the Dutch introduced a system of social stratification that was unknown to the Sumbanese. Each suku became a regency, or sometimes a sub-regency, headed by a raja appointed by the Dutch authorities. Such a political organization contrasted sharply with the indigenous system. By tradition, authority was partly a matter of alleged and mythical senior-ship often contested, particularly between ‘clans’, and partly a result of successful leadership in war. Under Dutch rule, the suku’s internal political organization was officially modified but the island’s division in suku was basically respected. Possibly the formal organization into kerajaan or ‘regencies’ implying more rigidly defined boundaries, may have even strengthened allegiance to the suku. Laboya became an autonomous regency, with its own raja … [4] … Independence of the Republic of Indonesia brought its own administrative changes. In modern Indonesia, a kecamatan is an administrative unit. In some cases in Sumba, a kecamatan corresponds exactly to a former regency, as in the case for Kodi. In other cases, however, a kecamatan may regroup several formerly autonomous areas. Thus the kecamatan of Walakaka embraces Laboya, Gaura, Wanokaka and Rua … But this administrative integration is too recent to have had a significant influence on feelings of identity with one’s suku.” (Geirnaert-Martin, 1992, pp. 3-4)

No political unity existed at the 'clan' level either. Laboya society consisted of kabihu ('clans') divided into Uma ('lineages' or 'houses'), which in turn consisted of multiple uma ('households'). Households were headed by senior men (Mori uma). Some Uma also had leaders or 'representatives' who did not have a name as such, but were referred to as 'elder brother' or 'father'. Kabihu do not appear to have had formal leadership, though they often had men called ata tada who acted as 'mediators'. Autonomous kabihu and Uma were called Inaya-Ama, 'Mother-Father'. 

""Laboya society consists of kabihu and uma. Onvlee, speaking about Sumabese communities in general, defines a kabihu or kabisu as a 'patrilineal and exogamous descent group', that is, a clan (1973:23; 102-112; 309) … However, some authors have questioned ‘the appropriateness of conventional anthropological concepts such as clan and lineage for the description of the social morphology’ of certain types of eastern Indonesian societies (Barraud and Platenkamp 1990: II-110).  Although I do not wish to discuss the problem of lineality in Eastern Indonesia, the question rises whether the unlinear principle implied by the terminology of 'clan' and 'lineage' truly corresponds to the situation in Laboya. It is for this reason that, in this book, I have opted for the indigenous terms kabihu and uma ... For the sake of clarity, I shall write Uma (House) when designating a group of people related by kin ties and uma when referring more specifically to the house as a building. This distinction is not always stated by the Laboya, the two meanings overlapping one another in many cases. But the Laboya do distinguish between the eldest male living in a particular house, the ‘Master/the Lord of a house’ called Mori uma, and the eldest male representative of an Uma. The latter is referred to as ‘elder brother’ (anguwu pa kaya) or ‘father’ (ama) by younger descendants who mostly inhabit other houses situated either in the same village or a different settlement. 

“[17] The territory of an Uma, hence of a kabihu, consists of a place in a village (harona) where the founding ancestors built the first house and of scattered plots of land belonging to its members … Among the Laboya, a kabihu encompasses a number of smaller units called Uma (Houses). The relationships between the Uma are conceived of in terms of patrilineal descent. The ranking order of the ‘Houses’ is determined by the mythical order of birth of their founding fathers. A kabihu consists of an ‘Elder House’ (Uma pa kaya) and of several ‘younger Houses’ (Uma pa ali.” (Geirnaert-Martin, 1992, pp. 17-18)

“In this complex situation, a crucial matter deserves special attention. When people want to stress the point that their kabihu or Uma is the unit that differentiates itself from other kabihu or Uma, they say that their kabihu or Uma is Inaya-Ama, ‘Mother-Father’ … In Laboya, Inya-Ama is explained as follows: ‘The fact that we are Inya-Ama demonstrates that nobody can give us orders.’

“Implicit in this statement lies the social rule according to which a younger brother has to obey and help his elder sibling. In rituals, representatives of a younger Uma must comply with the orders given by their counterparts in the eldest Uma. When they say ‘we are Inya-Ama’, the men of a particular Uma express the fact that as a genealogical unit, they have become independent because not even an elder branch can impose its rules upon them.” (Geirnaert-Martin, 1992, p. 19)

“The Laboya also make a social distinction between the ata pote and the ata tada. The ata pote (‘rich men’) do not accumulate goods for the pleasure of being rich … Rich men must have accordingly, that is, they must give many feasts to show their wealth and redistribute it, thereby re-activating long-standing relationships and creating new ones … In contrast, ata tada are not necessarily noble although they are never descendants of ‘slaves’. Nor are they necessarily very rich; yet a poor man can never become one of them. They are wise, mature men who have oratory skills and who know how to settle disputes. Nearly every kabihu has its own ata tada who may be requested to act as a go-between … during marriage settlements, or at the occasion of any ceremony during which gifts between wife-givers and wife-takers have to be exchanged.” (Geirnaert-Martin, 1992, p. 197)

Villages were made up of multiple kabihu, and kabihu were spread across multiple villages:

“In Laboya, several kabihu live in the same village (harona) and a settlement is not an exogamous unit as it is the case [sic] in Kodi.” (Geirnaert-Martin, 1992, p. 17, Footnote 2). 

“Geographically and ritually, Hodana is the centre of Laboya, from where all kabihu of Laboya proper and of Patyala have originated. Ideally, all of them are supposed to have their ancestral house in Hodana. In practice, several kabihu, for example Welowa, Ubumaleha and Kadengara, have established their own ancestral villages elsewhere long ago … [145] … The site where an ancestral house should stand is supposed to correspond to the one appointed by Ubu Raba, Ubu Rehi, Anamalangta Bawe and other apical ancestors. At the time when they organized Pa?u and Nyale, the ancestors assigned specific tasks in the yearly rituals to each kabihu and Uma and this arrangement is presented as immutable. In accordance with their ceremonial role during Paδu and Nyale, the kabihu were given a special place on which to build their first house. Therefore, the geographical mapping of Hodana corresponds to a ritually significant social division.” (Geirnaert, 1992, pp. 144-145)

The 'Mori uma' led the household in feasting and previously in warfare. The relationship between different Mori uma within the same Uma or Kabihu appears to have been fairly egalitarian:

“A ‘Mori uma’ or ‘Master of a house’, usually the eldest living male in a house, becomes a ‘Master of the feast’ … whenever he organizes a feast. He does not keep the honour and the renown he obtains on such an occasion all to himself. He must share it with his brothers who have been messengers between himself and his guests and have helped him with the organization … These rules are the same as the ones that applied in the past to the organization of headhunting raids. Ideally a war leader and his brothers first decided which men to ask to participate. Then brothers were sent off to visit those men and invite them. If the party succeeded in taking heads the war leader and his brothers shared the prestige obtained for organizing a successful raid. However, if one of the invited participants was injured or killed, the war leader and his brothers had the duty to pay a blood-price (taupe) to the family. Brothers, hence the members of an Uma and ultimately all brothers of a kabihu, are said to ‘share the same name’. A ‘man of renown’ (ata pagnara) shares his prestige with his brothers, that is the members of his Uma. If a kabihu consists of many Uma whose members are rich enough to give many feasts, the kabihu is considered as a ‘big kabihu with many children’: a particularly wealthy kabihu whose male members are able to marry several wives who then give birth to many children … [31] … The renown obtained by the living members of a kabihu or of an Uma when organizing successful feasts contributes to the permanence of that kabihu or Uma as a social unit, a totality, consisting of ancestors and of their descendants.” (Geirnaert-Martin, 1992, pp. 30-31)","geirnaert-martin1992[1-32, 193-227]"

‘Hena Manusa: Seven positions, seven nuru’ (Boulan-Smit, 1998, pp. 138-149)

The Alune lived in semi-autonomous territories called hena (domains). One of these hena, Manusa, is described in detail in the source (Boulan-Smit, 1998).

Governance of the hena was vested in the hena upui (‘grandfathers of the domain’). Boulan-Smit (1998, pp. 138-149) describes seven offices:

""Seven is also the number of functions and duties which order the ancient social [138] organisation of the hena to make it a complete body. These are the positions/duties (tugas) of hena upui grandfathers / ancestors of the hena'. At the present time, the seven hena upui are recalled as follows: Latu ela mena: ('Great lord in the front'), the leader/ruler/head, upu tapele: the lord of the land, maeta'e: the ritual performer, ama lesi: the warlord, ama nili: the saniri elder, peace negotiator, alamanane: the spokesman, and ama tita: the liaison agent … Let us  examine these functions more closely."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, pp. 137-138)

The offices of Latu ela mena, upu tapele, and maeta’e appear to have been the most important, since they were associated with the ‘three latu [lords]’ of the domain:

""Everybody in Manusa agrees that the three functions of leader, lord of the land and ritual performer were filled by the three latu."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 138)

The Latu ela mena ('leader') appears to have been the nominal leader of the domain. His role is somewhat obscure – in Manusa, where Boulan-Smit conducted her fieldwork, the office had long been unfilled. 

""Everybody in Manusa agrees that the three functions of leader, lord of the land and ritual performer were filled by the three latu. However, in the narrative the first leader, Latuelamena, left at the foundation of the domain. Some elders support the case that he was immediately replaced by the warlord, others that his powerless representative (Tibali, nicknamed ana sosi 'the ignorant child') filled his empty seat while his function was assumed by others. This is where tradition and official history are interwoven. No one remembers [139] who (other than Latuelamena) led Manusa before 1920, when colonial interference started to be felt and was documented."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, pp. 138-139)

The upu tapele ('lord of the land') was an authority on 'customary law and land tenure' within the hena, as well as having 'privileged contact with the ancestors of the hena':

""In Manusa, the 'lord of the land' (upu tapele) is indeed knowledgeable and regarded as the one to whom to refer on matters of customary law and land tenure as long as they concern the 'land' (tapele) and the 'custom' (atate) within the hena itself. The upu tapele is the descendant of the founding ancestor of the domain. Because of this ancestry he has a privileged contact with the ancestors of the hena … However an upu is the lord, the custodian, the guardian, the person having duties and responsibilities toward something, but not its owner."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 140)

The maeta'e ('ritual performer') 'collected offerings' for domain-wide rituals and was also an officiant of the Kakehan (a ritual 'brotherhood'):

""The ritual performer collected the offerings of all the nuru for their common ritual centre on Nuruitu. He was also the ritual officiant of the Kakehan ('a'ehane) in the 'men's house' (luma tutue) before the prohibition of initiation and men's rituals in the 1920s, when the village officially converted to Christianity."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 142)

The ama lesi appears to have been some kind of shaman as well as a warlord:

""Van Wouden attributed to the malesi the role of a 'champion' but also the duties of a diviner or an astrologer, an activity he did not investigate further. Shamanism was a common practice among Alune elders before the conversion to Christianity. The shamanic aspect of the amalesi's charge applied in matters which concerned his field of specialisation i.e. warfare, head hunting, the movements of the group (he led migrations), protection or extension of the boundaries, and men's activities related to the forest."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 142)

The ama nili headed the domain council and represented the domain on larger councils. This role may have been a new (postcolonial?) introduction:

""The function I call peace negotiator is ama nili: 'saniri father'. In peace time, his role was to head the 'village council of elders' (nili) and to act as the representative of the hena in the larger saniri (nili ela) of the river batai. As head of the elders' council he was expected to be [144] knowledgeable in customary matters, more specifically in what concerned the administrative relationship with the outside, including land boundaries … For some village elders, the function is regarded as a 'new' one."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, pp. 143-144)

The roles of alamanane and the ama tita (‘left hand’ and ‘right hand’) were clearly subsidiary. The former assisted the maeta’e (Boulan-Smit, 1998, pp. 145-146), and the latter assisted the village council (p. 146). 

Altogether, authority at the hena level appears to have been dispersed, and religious and political authority partially separated. The maeta’e appears to have been the primary religious official, but the upu tapele and ama lesi also had religious functions. Political authority appears to have been shared between several figures, including but not limited to the upu tapele and ama lesi.

Above the hena level, the Alune were part of a larger (but less centralized) politico-religious system that integrated most if not all of Western Seram. Since this system was politically dominated by non-Alune it is excluded from consideration, but is described below for completeness. 

Most if not all of the people of Western Seram, including descendants of recent immigrants, considered themselves to belong to the Pata Siwa (Group of Nine) moiety, in contrast to the Pata Lima (Group of Five) moiety of eastern Seram, and furthermore shared a common myth of origin involving the Nunusaku tree. Most Siwa (though not all - p. 80) were part of a system of 'assemblies' (Saniri or Niri) that met at the level of the river valley (batai) and the 'region' (which consisted of three batai and included most of Western Seram). 

The Pata Siwa were divided into 'Black Siwa' and 'White Siwa'. The former were 'mountain people' (Alune and Wemale) and belonged to a secret society called the 'Kakehan', whereas the latter were coastal Muslims, who did not. 

""West Seram was a densely forested area at the periphery of a large trading operation controlled by the northern Sultanates and later by the VOC. Ternate had a Gubemur in Huamual and several vassal settlements on the south and north coasts. The interior was occupied by small rival groups, scattered along the valleys of the main rivers. Small scale warfare and head-hunting was current both in the mountains and at the coast, and everybody lived in mutual suspicion. Yet exchanges were vital and alliances, even temporary ones, were indispensable. Periodic assemblies of the elders, called nili, facilitated the relationships between various units. This widespread institution, which assembled the elders in each domain, also met at river and regional level. Although every small unit remained fiercely
independent, these councils maintained some communication and coordination between the various coastal and mountain groups of the region. The oral tradition confirms the ancient
existence of these nili assemblies in west Seram. They gathered the representatives of small and large units at the level of domains (nili hena), river valley (nili ela) or region (nili 'wele
batai telu or saniri hutu). Matters of regional interest and precedence were settled at these councils at legislative and judicial level and later registered within the oral tradition ... [73] ... The mountain people of west Seram were Black Siwa (Kakehan initiates), and the coastal settlers White Siwa, but all were Pata Siwa, (Group of Nine), while the east of the island was inhabited by the Pata Lima (Group of Five). Although this is not the case anymore, we may suppose that it gave the Siwa a minimal sense of common identity. The mountain people depended on the coast to obtain goods like salt, weapons or heirloom objects; and the coastal settlers, who dreaded them, traded forest products and services for these goods. Furthermore, the idea of a common origin linked to a central mountain and to a sacred banyan tree called Nunusaku, was largely shared throughout west Seram, even among the coastal newcomers. Finally, the forced dispersion over west Seram of a large fraction of the population of Huamual, a powerful and entrepreneurial dependency of Temate, in the 17th century, probably gave the nili institution its impetus on a wider regional scale."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, pp. 72-73)

The Nili and Kakehan were seen as belonging to the administrative and religious spheres respectively. Political precedence seems to have been accorded to the coastal Muslims, who outranked the mountain people in the nili. However, the Kakehan was restricted to the mountain people, who furthermore were seen as the 'guardians of the Nunusaku' (this honour was claimed by the Alune domain of Manusa specifically, but it is unclear how widely this claim was recognised). The Kakehan and Nunusaku appear to have been linked in some way, though it is not clear exactly how:

“The mountain people of west Seram were Black Siwa (Kakehan initiates), and the coastal settlers White Siwa, but all were Pata Siwa, (Group of Nine), while the east of the island was inhabited by the Pata Lima (Group of Five). Although this is not the case anymore, we may suppose that it gave the Siwa a minimal sense of common identity ... Furthermore, the idea of a common origin linked to a central mountain and to a sacred banyan tree called Nunusaku, was largely shared throughout west Seram, even among the coastal newcomers.” (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 73)

“Spreading its branches to the Sky (Lanite) and its roots into the Earth (Tapele), Nunusaku is also the source of the three rivers, Eti, Tala and Sapalewa, which give the area its name: the Three Rivers, 'Wele Batai Telu. The people established in this area and those living on the southern islands of Ambon and Uliase, all link their origin to the Nunusaku, even the population of mixed origin. Most regard the Alune and Wemale mountain people of west Seram as the direct descendants and thus the custodians of the Nunusaku."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 101)

“Besides being the historical validation of their territorial claims and the justification of their political position toward external and internal affairs, this topogeny supports the establishment of their macrocosmic order. It confirms Manusa as one source/centre through the deeds of its founding ancestor. It also positions the hena as custodian (not owner) of Nunusaku, the ultimate sacred centre of the region, which joins Tapele, the Earth, to Lanite, the Sky, the microcosm to the macrocosm.” (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 103)

""Along the coasts down from each valley, large settlements of mixed population were controlled by Muslim rulers allied to Ternate. Eti in the Eti valley, Kairatu in the Tala, and Lissabata in the Sapalewa were such coastal centres in the nineteenth century. Through wealth, influence and politics, their leaders nominally controlled each valley (batai), heading large assemblies (nili) of the representatives of each riverine domain ... [276] ... The centre of power of the batai had its base (uwei) at the coast and its ramifications in the mountains. Larger ceremonial assemblies were also held at federative level. They convened the warlords, leaders and ritual performers of all the domains which were members of the Kakehan. The male brotherhood demanded of its initiates a vow of secrecy in regard to their belief, their initiation rituals and head hunting practices. Infringement led to dishonourable death. This knowledge, which elders say 'pertains to Nunusaku', had its symbolic centre in the mountains among the black Siwa; the white Siwa being the populations at its coastal periphery."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, pp. 275-276)

There was also a 'coalition' of Alune hena within one batai that was represented in the Nili, and does not appear to have had any religious role:

“Inland, west of the Sapalewa, was the independent coalition of the nili Kwele Batai, the Saniri of the Trunk of the Large River. It brought together the Alune mountain settlements of Rumasoal (sarimeten of Sapalewa), Riring (anakota of Sapalewa) with those of Niniari, Murikau and Lumoli, three mountain villages of the upper Eti river. This mountain/indigenous coalition had its own representatives in the large Saniri. It counterbalanced the coastal powers of Kaibobo (Eti) and Lisabata (Sapalewa), two former Muslim vassals of the Ternatan governor of Luhu in Huamual.” (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 79)

More on the Kakehan:

“The division between black and white siwa is given several explanations. The colour black is usually related to the tattoo of the members of the Kakehan initiation brotherhood. Most of the black tattooed siwa lived in the mountains. They were distinguished from the white or not tattooed siwa, the non-initiated people living in the coastal regions of 'Wele Telu. Hence, this distinction between initiates and non-initiates demarcated the mountain from the coastal populations (although some individuals of the coast were initiated).” (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 115)

""As Sachse comments, the prohibition of the Kakehan in 1914 had left a spiritual vacuum."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 65)

""The authors usually translate mauwen or (mawene) anakota (captain of a boat) as 'high priest' because the mauwena were also leading dignitaries in the Kakehan. Indeed, the role of the Kakehan was also to ensure that traditional law was implemented among its members."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 78)

""Although a lot has been written about the Kakehan little is known about this men's cult, the role of its ritual performers, its initiation rituals and head hunting practices."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 142)

""In archives, mauwen is usually translated by 'Kakehan priest' ... The mauwen anakota was the leader of the local unit of the Kakehan cult."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 147)

""Somehow the church replaced the Kakehan house. An elder said that formerly Manusa had been the centre of initiation for
several mountain communities and it was thus normal that it now had the largest church."" (Boulan-Smit, 1998, p. 355)","boulan-smit-1998[71-132, 138-139, 275-276]"

The Atayal lived in villages (karan), loosely grouped into 'tribes' (leliyong). Tribes are described as 'rarely political entities', an important exception being the Kalaisan tribe, who were organized as a 'superconfederacy' with two levels of jurisdiction above the local community:

""Approximately 40 of these so-called tribes were identified by Japanese ethnologists for the Atayal as a whole ... Chinese ethnographers have concentreated on the largest of these 'tribes,' the Kalaisan (Nanao) in the extreme east of the Atayal area, and specifically on the ethnically mixed village of Nanao, nowadays numbering some 1,200 people and located on the coastal plain in close proximity to lowland Chinese (cf. Li et al. 196). [Mabuchi 1960, 1966; Wei 1963; Ho 1956)."" (Lebar, 1975, p. 143)

""For defense against headhunting, the villages in a drainage area have tended to form loosely organized, named federations of 'tribes,' termed by Atayal qotox leliyung (leliong), 'those of the river'. These so-called 'tribes' were rarely political entities, and member villages usually retained political autonomy, with 'tribal' chiefs emerging only in war-[147] time and then only temporarily (Mabuchi 1966). For the Nanao Atayal, however, Li et al (1963:147ff.) describe a rather elaborate structure of villages organized into regional federations and these in turn into a single superconfederacy, with chiefs and sub-chiefs at all levels."" (Lebar, 1975, pp 146-147). 

More on the Kəlaisan Federation:

“Relating local deviations from the norm of traditional Atayal mortuary customs to different descent and/or ethnohistory in cases where the sources permit such an attempt, is not feasible in this context. However, a glimpse of the complexities of descent and ethnohistory, both in consequence of the expansion and subsequent intrusive colonial policies, may be of interest. The ethnohistory of quotux ləliyun Kəlaisan (one river, meaning a defensive league of villages in the drainage area of one river/creek), the so-called Kəlaisan Federation, although probably the most complex of all, is a case in point.

“The 13 original qalan (villages) of the Kəlaisan Federation were situated at altitudes above 1,000 m on the upper and middle reaches of the [274] Hoping River. Kəlaisan is a collective name given to them by other Atayal groups. Their self-appelations are, depending on descent, kəna-xaqul, Məbeala, Manebo, and Tausa respectively. Their ethnic composition, therefore, includes members of all three subgroups Sqoleq Ts’ole and Sediq who in rapid succession left their respective former homes and joined newly founded villages, although by different routes and way-stations … UTSURIKAWA Nenozo, MABUCHI Tôichi and MIYAMOTO Nobutu (1935:32) stated that the original Kəlaisan villages of Təpiaxan, Gogot, Piəəxau, Talənan, Rəginox Kiniyan, Babo-lelao, Rəgerəx, Xaga-paris, Tubulag, Moyau, Babo-kaikai, and Ləyoxen consisted of approximately 220 households (34.9%) of Məbeala, 280 households (44.4%) of Kəna-Xaqul, 90 households (14%) of Tausa and 40 households (6.3%) of Manebo descent.” (Kaneko, 2000, pp. 273-274)

According to Okada (1959, cited in Lebar, 1975, p. 145), mean household size was 4.8 for the Atayal as a whole (6.6 for the Tse'ole subgroup). The 630 households of the Kəlaisan Federation would imply a total population of about 3,000 if they were of average size. According to Alvarez (1927) the Atayal population was estimated to be 27,766 in 1910, so the Kalaisan would have made up not much more than 10% of the total. 

The rest of the Atayal appear to have lived in independent villages. Some villages were coextensive with 'ritual groups' (qotox gaga), whereas other villages were divided into separate ritual groups, and some ritual groups encompassed whole 'tribes'. Ritual groups were headed by a figure that Lebar calls the 'gaga chief'. The role of the gaga chief appears to have been primarily religious. It is unclear whether gaga chiefs also had secular power, though the fact that their responsibilites included 'public affairs' suggests that they may have been. Whether centralized political authority aside from that of the gaga chief existed at the village level prior to colonisation is unclear from the following excerpt. In the village of Nanao the gaga chiefs formed a council that had 'real power' and a nominal leader, but it is unclear how typical this was:

""The basic unit in Atayal society is the so-called ritual group (qotox gaga), an organization of patrilineally related persons observing a common set of taboos and ritual procedures (gaga) inherited from a common set of ancestors in order to maintain the spiritual protection of those ancestors. A gaga 'owns' its ancestral spirits (rutux) and shares in the communal eating of its sacred millet (gaxak), the latter under the protection of the gaga chief/priest, a person skilled in memorizing prayers and ritual sequences, reciting tribal history, and conducting public affairs (Li et al. 1963:204) ... In some areas, ritual group equals village, whereas in others a village may be composed of several ritual groups. In like manner the village-cum-ritual group may in some cases correspond to the hunting group or a feast group, in others not. In the southwest 'homeland,' an entire village federation or 'tribe' may comprise a single ritual group (Mabuchi 1966L 112; Kojima 1915-22:1,57). [Li et al. 1963:90-91, 121-65, 204; Yuan 1964:153; Wei 1958a: 34, 1963; Kojima 1915-22:1,57-58) ... By all accounts the local settlement was originally a cluster of neighbouring hamlets whose inhabitants constituted a localized kin group functioning as a single riitual group ... Modern administrative villages ... with village headmen and other functionaries, were created by successive Japanese and Chinese governments in an effort to gain political control in tribal areas (Okada 1959). For the village of Nanao, Li et al. (1963:121-64) describe a village chief (meraho galang), elected from among village gaga heads. The latter, as 'keepers of the holy millet', hold real power, exercised in a village council. The position of village chief tends to be hereditary within a prominent or 'founding' patrilineage, and by primogeniture (Wei 1958a, Li et al. 1963: 142ff) ... [147] ... Headmen and councils judge serious cases and impose fines, the amount of which is usually arbitrated by influential persons representing the two sides. The chief mechanism of social control is, however, the informal working of collective responsibility within the ritual group."" (Lebar, 1975, pp. 146-147)

Kaneko certainly implies that village chiefs and councils pre-dated Japanese colonisation:

“A few aspects hint at an incipient meritocracy in Atayal society. Successful warriors, hunters and headhunters, respected gagâ-chiefs, influential men and great orators, and women who were skilful weavers enjoyed great prestige and displayed the insignia of their respected status, such as tattoos, shellbead-embroidered or red ceremonial garments and copper bracelets. Men of great achievement were elected to the office of chief of the village council, or leader of war, headhunting, or hunting parties, but these functions usually ended with the specific task at hand. In some villages of the colonized area, the position of village chief was hereditary in the patrilineage of the village founder. Considerable friction was caused by the fact that the permanent chiefs appointed by the police did not necessarily coincide with the men the Atayal considered leaders.""

18888,kwaraae,84,3,149-3,"The Kwara'ae lived in small territories ('ano' or 'fanoa') centred on shrines ('feraābu'). Each of these territories appears to have been occupied by a small descent group that Burt calls a 'small clan' or 'local clan', which was part of a dispersed 'big clan'. Each 'small clan' had a priest (fataābu). Some shrines were considered to belong to 'big clans', and hence their priests were in some sense the priests of the entire dispersed group:

""Although the genealogies remembered by different clans often disagree on how they are related to one another, it is none the less generally acknowledged that all Kwara’ae, if not all Malaitans, are descended from one man whose sons and grandsons dispersed from their home in the central bush to the lands which now belong to the Kwara’ae people. Their claims to this land today are traced back to the time when these ancient ancestors discovered areas of virgin forest [25] which they settled by clearing land for villages and gardens … The settlement and burial sites of these men … were dedicated to them as ‘tabu places’ (kula ābu) by their descendants, and the names of these places were given to the surrounding areas and the communities that lived there. In some of these places they built shrines (feraābu) where the ghosts remained in continuing association with the land … In a country where people often move their settlements and the forest soon covers all signs of human habitation, ‘tabu places’ are the permanent signs of rights in land established by notable ancestors and [26] inherited by their descendants to the present day ...Kwara’ae often refer to such an area simply as a ‘land’ (ano), but it is also a ‘home’ or habitation, fanoa, a word which covers any inhabited space from a village to the whole of Kwara’ae or Malaita ... A Kwara’ae ‘clan’ can mean a group of hundreds of people tracing descent from a common ancestor ten or twenty generations ago. But those who live together in the same neighbourhood may amount to no more than the families of two [27] or three ‘father’, ‘brothers’ and ‘sons’, as a local sub-clan descended from the same father or grandfather. Kwara’ae distinguish these more or less inclusive groups only as ‘big’ or ‘small’ clans. In the past extended families of the same local clan would have formed separate small settlements (fanoa), hardly large enough to be called villages and probably seldom larger than two or three households each … Men of a clan, particularly those who live together, normally have a strong sense of solidarity and identity, not only with the living but also with the dead ancestors whom they replace generation after generation as heirs to the land … As a clan they are usually named for places inherited from these ancestors, where, in the past, the men sought spiritual support and protection by sharing sacrificial meals of pigs and vegetables with their ghosts at shrines marking the land they claimed. The greatest of these sacrifices were periodic festivals (maoma) in which large numbers of pigs were sacrificed to all the ancestors of the clan while feeding and entertaining relatives and neighbours from far and wide … The priest (fataābu) whom the ancestors chose to mediate between them and the living was ideally the firstborn man of the senior line, so that the list of principal ancestors through which the clan traced its descent would often be conceived as a list of successive priests who were also the leaders for the land ... The following brief history is based on research by Adriel Rofate’e into the origins of his own clan of Gwauna’ongi … [27] … In about 1920, when the Gwauna’ongi people because Christians, they included four or five more or less distinct subclans … amounting altogether to probably little more than twenty families. Ten independent clans further away were also regarded as in some sense belonging to Gwaunga’ongi. Each of these clans would sacrifice to their own ancestors at local shrines and hold sacrificial festivals for them every few years. But all of them, even those living far away, would also maintain links with the land and people they had ‘emerged from’ (saka ana) by sending back occasional sacrifices to the ancient common ancestors cared for by the priests of Faureba … Gwauna’ongi is only one of several places in the central bush from which groups of local clans in East and West Kwara’ae trace their common origins, remembered through genealogies and reaffirmed through sacrifices sent back ‘up’ to their ancient ancestors. But these major clans did not in themselves form local communities. Kwara’ae histories show how, as clans continued to disperse generation after generation, they settled not only on vacant land but also on land already claimed by other clans, to produce a pattern of clan-land relationships of bewildering complexity. "" (Burt, 1994, pp. 24-28)

""The priest’s congregation and sphere of influence centred on his local clan group of fathers, brothers and sons and their families."" (Burt, 1994, p. 67)

""As ‘important men’, priests contributed to exchanges of wealth and feasting through the sacrificial system, receiving on behalf of the ghosts both pigs and shell money offerings used to buy pigs, which were shared with other adult men in sacrificial meals and festivals. Sacrifices to ancestors also brought together their dependants within the local clan and beyond. When people were asked for pigs by ancestors from whom they were ‘born of women’, the sacrifice reaffirmed relationships with uncles and cousins in other clans, and claims to their clan lands. When they sent pigs ‘up’ to the ancient ancestors of their own clan at the shrines they derived from generations ago, they joined a wider congregation of local clans under the leadership of a priest of the senior line. The priests in charge of the ancient shrines of dispersed clans … had special opportunities for leadership through the hierarchical descent system ... Priesthood had its greatest scope for leadership in the ‘festivals’ (maoma, from mao, ‘dance’) which united the living and dead members of a clan in peace and friendship with relatives and neighbours in the wider community. (Burt, 1994, p. 69)

""The scale of a festival reflected the prosperity and power of the clan and its ancestral ghosts. In recent times, with congregations depleted by conversion to Christianity, they have been quite modest affairs … A few generations ago things were very different … Such was the case with Siale, widely regarded as the most ancient shrine in Kwara’ae. Among the many clans which trace their origins to the first ancestors who settled there from overseas, a group of four or five clans, widely dispersed from the lands near Siale from which they are named, joined to celebrate festivals at the shrine. Their priests each had particular ritual tasks under the leadership of the senior priest responsible for the Siale shrine itself … Siale is by no means the only shrine where festivals on this scale were once held.

“There is no doubt that the first-fruits ‘inasi ceremony was the most important religious event of the year, since it was observed by all the people of Tonga … It represented an offering of the first products of the land, as well as other edibles such as fish, to all of the gods through the person of the divine chief Tu’i Tonga."" (Ferdon, 1987, p. 82)

“Like the differences between gods and their attributes on Tongatapu and on the northern islands of Vava’u and Ha’apai, the limiting of the tautau ceremonies to these latter islands is yet another indication of a former societal separation within the Tongan archipelago. Just when the entire group came under the domination of Tongatapu is not clear. That this did occur, at least by late prehistoric times, is strongly suggested by the pan-Tongan occurrence of the two Tu’i tonga ‘inasi ceremonies with their heavy tribute … Although the tribute demands of the Tu’i Tonga spread to the northern islands, the other gods of Tongatapu were less successful and failed to penetrate the traditional religion of the north.” (Ferdon, 1987, p. 95)",ferdon1987[69-95]

'Gaiča' (Guiart, 1963, pp. 455-477)

'Lösi' (Guiart, 1963, pp. 478-544)

There were three 'chiefdoms' or 'districts' on Lifou: Weṭ, Gaiča, and Lösi. 

All three consisted of multiple villages:

« La disposition des villages de Weṭ, autour de la plaine de Wanaham, et l’evolution particulière de leur organisation, à tous les nivaux, permet d’adopter ici pour l’exposé un plan fonctionnel. » (Guiart, 1963, p. 352)

(The arrangement of the villages of Weṭ, around the plain of Wanaham, and the particular evolution of their organization, at all levels, makes it possible for us to present here a functional plan.)

« Le district de Gaiča, district central, est le moins étendu en superficie. Le plus faiblement peupléaussi, puisqu’il ne comprenait que 1 162 habitants en 1954, répartis en quatre villages. » (Guiart, 1963, p. 455)

List of the thirteen villages of Lösi: Guiart (1963, p. 538)

The high chieftainship of Weṭ belonged to a kin group called Wenedhia. The Wenedhia had originally installed as the chiefs by groups called the Atesi and the Haeta, who still had special privileges:

« La grand chef actuel, Pascal Sihaze, écrivait à notre usage:

« ‹ La famille actuelle du grand chef de Weṭ sort de la souche de Wenedhia, du clan, Gala. Ce sont les Atesi et les Haeta qui ont élu primitivement Wenedhia au trône de la chefferie de Hnupel. Une cérémonie coutumière commémore cet événement, encore de nos jours, par le champ d’ignames de Keny que le grand chef doit cultivar pour en donner la récolte aux Atesi et aux Haeta.›

« Cette version, simple et vraisemblable, se présente comme l’expression d’une verité officiell. Nombreux sont les informateurs qui, de manière plus ou moins hardie, plus ou moins precise, désirent y apporter des complements, si ce n’est que par allusions. » (Guiart, 1956, p. 352)

(""The current high chief, Pascal Sihaze, wrote for us:

""'The family of the current high chief of Weṭ belong to the stock of Wenedhia, of the clan Gala. It was the Atesi and Haeta who first elected Wenedhia to the throne of the chiefdom of Hnupel. A customary ceremony commemorates this event, even today, by the yam field of Keny which the high chief must cultivate to give the harvest to the Atesi and Haeta.'

""This version, simple and plausible, is presented as the expression of an official truth. There were many informants who, more or less boldy, more or less precisely, wished to add to it, if only by allusions."")

The high chieftainship of Wenedhia appears to have been mostly nominal. Secular authority largely appears to have been shared by various officials within the wider Gala clan to which Wenedhia belonged:

« Les ‹ sujets › du grand chef Ukeinesö sont les gens dit Angete Gala, membres du même clan, dont le premier chef connu, Wenedhia, fut intronisé grand chef de Weṭ. WAḌAWA DHOXU, chef de la branche des Api Wathodhè, est considéré comme le chef du clan (tixei angete Gala), second en autorité à nul autre qu’Ukeneisö lui- même.

« C’est lui qui ordonne les travaux à l’intérieur de la chefferie. Il peut délégeur cette fonction, mais seulement à titre temporare, à Hno, chef de la branche de Gala dite des Api Gwiet, ou à Čo, chef des Api Ḍawan.

« HWENEGEI, de Čiole (Kirinata), autre personage Api Gẅiet, est le hwat e Gala: il parle pour le grand chef quand celui-ci reçoit le hwémék, le don de bienvenue présénté par un autre grand chef en visite; si le grand chef se déplace, il l’accompagne afin de parler au nom de tous les Angete Gala; cette function fait qu’il ne doit pas le hoṭ à son chef de clan, mais donne une offrande, dite xeninehlapa, au grand chef pour le [361] terrain de Geigei, oú ce dernier envoya résider ses ancêtres ... HNO, chef des Api Gẅiet, est plus particulièrement le chef de guerre de Wet. Son clan représenterait une branche aînée par rapport à celle même d’Ukeinesö. » (Guiart, 1956, pp. 360-361)

(""The 'subjects' of the great chief Ukeinesö are the people known as Angete Gala, members of the same clan, whose first known chief, Wenedhia, was enthroned great chief of Weṭ. 

""WAḌAWA DHOXU, head of the Api Wathodhè branch, is considered the head of the clan (tixei angete Gala), second in authority to none other than Ukeneisö himself.

""It is he who orders the work inside the chiefdom. He can delegate this function, but only temporarily, to Hno, head of the Gala branch known as the Api Gwiet, or to Čo, head of the Api Ḍawan.

""HWENEGEI, from Čiole (Kirinata), another Api Gẅiet character, is the hwat e Gala: he speaks for the great chief when he receives the hwémék, the gift of welcome presented by another visiting great chief; if the great chief moves, he accompanies him in order to speak on behalf of all the Angete Gala; this function means that he does not owe the ḥoṭ [tribute] to his clan chief, but gives an offering, known as xeninehlapa, to the great chief for the land of Geigei, where the latter sent his ancestors to reside ... HNO, chief des Api Gẅiet, is more particularly the war leader of Wet. His clan represents an elder branch than that of Ukeinesö itself."")

Secular authority in Lösi was structured as follows: 

« Au sommet de la hiérachie nous avons donc:

« BULA, descendant de Wahemunemè; c’est l’angaghoxu(e), le grand chef.

« Puis, tout d’abord les dhin, dont le chef est GOP(É) ANGADHOXU(E) dit pour cela tixe i ange čipa; il est la ‹bouche du chef›, celui qui transmet les ordres au peuple; de même que, semble-t-il, l’exécuter des hautes oeuvres et le champion du Lösi à la guerre, role où il avait un partenaire … Hnaxu(e) Viliamo est plus simplement la tête de lignée des ANG API ČO, celle des ANG API KAI était le grand chef lui-même, Henri Bula Čakin(è). » (Guiart, 1963, p. 536)

(""At the top of the hierarchy we have therefore:

'The system of the political community in Timor, summary' (Schulte Nordholt, 1971, pp. 368-391)


Schulte Nordholt (1971, pp. 186-231) provides a detailed description of the organization of one Atoni princedom, Insana, which was somewhat atypical since it was never part of the realm of Sonba’i. The author also provides a survey of various others, and discusses the similarities and differences (see p. 381 for a summary). A simplified summary follows. Everywhere the ruler of the princedom was called the atupas. In Insana and possibly Beboki (also outside Sonba’i) the atupas was assisted by a figure called the kolnel (Portuguese ‘colonel’), though this figure did not exist further west. Below the atupas (or the atupas-kolnel in the east) were figures called usif. In Insana and Beboki there were four, each associated with a ‘quarter’ of the princedom, whereas elsewhere there were only two and they were not linked to territorial units. At the same hierarchical level as the usif were the amaf naek (‘great fathers’). In Insana and Beboki they each headed a ‘quarter’ (the same as were headed by the usif), and also played the role of tobe naek.  This quadripartite division also seems to have occurred elsewhere, though it is not clear quite how widespread it was. At a lower level were village elders (amaf or amnasi), each of which represented a particular lineage (ume) localised in one of the hamlets (kuan) which made up a village (also called kuan). 

Schulte Nordholt (1971, pp. 326-367) describes the ‘functioning of the political community’ in some detail. The three basic functions he mentions were warfare, administration, and ‘administration of justice’.","schulte-nordholt1971[186-231, 326-391]"
18121,rennell,84,3,149-3,"Settlement on Rennell was traditionally dispersed:

“The introduction of Christianity has recently caused a change in the type of settlement. As NORTHCOTE DECK has it: ‘The result has been a wonderful revolution in their social life. For whereas before, they lived scattered about in the bush, just one or two families together, so great has been their desire to be taught of God, that the whole population … has come together in about ten large villages’. Whether the good missionary’s enthusiasm is legitimate from an economic point of view is, perhaps, questionable, and in actual fact it is somewhat exaggerated. There are still but three or four villages with more than about 50 inhabitants such as Lavanggu, which is a quite modern creation due to the anchorage in Kanggava Bay … Other fairly large villages are Te Avamanggu in the western part of the island, Hutuna on the southern shore of the lake, and Tingoa at its eastern extremity. But in many cases people still live in small clusters of houses scattered over the island near the lake and along the fertile zone. The greatest number of dwellings originally observed by NORTHCOTE DECK in a single place was eight.” (Birket-Smith, 1969, p 45)

Traditionally, the island was divided into six 'chieftainships'. One of these, Te Nggano, was considered 'the principal chieftainship':

""As previously mentioned the native name of Rennell is Munggava or ‘the large island’, in contradistinction to Munggiki, [39] ‘the small island’, also known as Bellona. Tradition tells us that originally both islands were ruled by a common chief who lived on Bellona, but sixteen or seventeen generations ago the [40] Bellona chief, Taupongi, was killed and his four sons separated. One of them, Manu, stayed on Bellona; another one, Sao-e-mangongena, was killed like his father and his people scattered, whereas Uaimango and Maitongo went to Rennell and settled at Lake Te Nggano. Up to the present day Te Nggano is considered the principal chieftainship, and its head occupies a position superior to that of the other chiefs of the island. Around Kanggava Bay, immediately west of Te Nggano, is the chieftainship of Te Mungginuku; it is also known as Te Manggavai, which is, however,more or less a nick-name. Then follows Banggikanggo, the principal settlement of which is Te Avamanggu, Te Tuakoi, and Taungganggoto with Hatanggoa as the main village, and farthest to the west Senggema, where the largest village is Kanggoa."" (Birket-Smith, 1969, pp. 38-40)

Taupongi, who occupied the Te Nggano chieftainship in the 1930s through the the 1950s, was considered the 'high chief of the whole island', though it is not clear that he had more than nominal power over the other chiefs (the various chieftainships often fought each other):

""For administrative purposes Rennell is divided into three districts, Te Nggano, Kanggava, and Te Manggihenua. Each district has a headman who is appointed by the Governmcnt with the common consent of the people and is paid a salary af £2 a month. During our sojourn the headmen were the three chiefs, Taupongi. Tahua, and Tigesua, but it must not necessarily be a chief. Both Taupongi and Tigesua were dignified old gentlemen, and Taupongi in particular, who was the old high chief of the whole island, possessed no little authority ... Tahua was somewhat younger and not very popular."" (Birket-Smith, 1969, p. 18)

""Bellona was the only island with which Rennell had regular intercourse, though not always of a peaceful character. The same is true of the districts on Rennell itself. LAMBERT emphasizes the jealousy between Te Nggano, the original population centre, and Te Mungginuku- or, as he calls it, Kolugu - around Kanggava Bay, which acquired added importance in modern times on account of the anchorage there, and says that it resulted in a war when the ancestors of that chief settled in the latter place three generations ago. It was quite evident, also when we visited the island, that relations were rather strained between the old high [117] chief, Taupongi, and Tahua, the chief of Te Mungginuku. As a rule, however, the three eastern districts, Te Nggano, Te Mungginuku, and Banggikanggo were allied against the westernmost ones, Taungganggotu and Senggema. Thus, for instance, was the state of affairs during the last war on the island. The central chieftainship, Te Tuakoi, was connected by family ties to both sides and joined sometimes one and sometimes the other of the fighting parties and enjoyed the doubtful privilege of being the habitual battle field."" (Birket-Smith, 1969, pp. 116-117)

Chiefs appear to have been the main (and perhaps the only) religious practitioners on Rennell Island:

""The chiefs, anggiki, claim to descend from Kaitu'u, the leader of the first immigrants, and through him they also descend from
Te Hainggi-atua. No wonder, therefore, that the chiefs of Rennell
like those of other Polynesian islands were sacreu. At interval
they were possessed by a spirit so that they fell into a trance,
and they would also summon the gods to the assembling places
or make them enter the sacred emblems. Their authority seemed to a great extent to depend upon their ability to being entranced, and in practice this might even influence the succession although the dignity theoretically passed to the oldest son."" (Birket-Smith, 1969, p. 41)

""A separate priesthood does not occur."" (Birket-Smith, 1969, p. 45)

Birket-Smith (1969, pp. 59-63), citing Macgregor (1943), describes series of harvest ceremonies led by Taupongi at Te Nggano in the 1930s. It is unclear whether these ceremonies was performed for the welfare of the whole island or Te Nggano alone, but given the closely interwoven nature of religious and political authority on Rennell and Taupongi's status as high chief, the former seems more likely:

“Regular first-fruit offerings to Te Haingi-atua and Te Hua-i-ngavenga were made of taro and of both species of yam, as well [60] as of coconuts the first time the tree bears fruit ... The ceremonies took place on the nggoto-manggae, where the fruits provided for Te Hainggi-atua were placed in front of the chief's house, because he was the supreme god, and those offered to Te Hua-i-nggavenga behind the house. I heard nothing of the offering at the ancestral graves mentioned by HOGBIN ... MACGREGOR has given a detailed account of the food offering he witnessed during his stay at Te Nggano. Yams and taro were piled on the nggoto-manggae, and dancing commenced at sunset to be continued at daybreak. During the morning dance the chief- the same Taupongi who was still high chief at the time of our visit -was sitting in his house on a new mat spread over two coconut fronds, and on the western side of the manggae was placed a mat-covered board spread over more fronds and intended for seats for the visiting gods. When the dance was finished, the chief sat down on the board and invited the god (Te Hainggi-atua?) to his seat of honour in front of the house. Then, with a ceremonial spear in his hand, he took some yams, spoke over them and ordered three ‘headmen’ (nobles?) to put them aside in baskets, whereas the rest were divided into piles in a line at the side of the assembling place. After another invocation he led the men in a dance, at the close of which he again addressed the gods before the yams, and now the men formed a line moving backwards and forwards with bowing gestures in order to lead the god into [61] the house from which he was supposed to depart, in conclusion slapping the roof of the house while the chief delivered a short speech. Finally the men carried the yams to the women behind the house where the earth oven had been prepared in which the yams were cooked during the day. In the evening they were taken to the chief, who placed them on a sand mat before the middle post on the front side of the house, partook a little of four yams on behalf of the god, and gave the rest to his household.” (Birket-Smith, 1969, pp. 59-61)","birket-smith1969[38-45, 59-63, 116-117]"

""By comparison, Berawan society is small in scale, relatively egalitarian, and composed of just four autonomous ritual and political units - the separate longhouse communities.""(Huntington & Metcalf, 1979, pp 133-134)

‘Prestigious men’ appear to have served as the main political and religiousl leaders (they directed mortuary rites, nulang, described as the ‘central’ component of Berawan religion). There appears to have been only one ‘outstandingly prestigious’ man in each community. However, this does not appear to have been an office in the sense of ‘a standardized group of duties and privileges devolving upon a person in certain defined situations’ (Hughes, 1937). Rather than the right to organise a nulang being vested in the role of ‘prestigious man’, organising nulang led to recognition as a prestigious man. 

""In each longhouse, one family apartment is designated as that of the chiefly family, the former residence of the last outstandingly prestigious man of the community."" (Huntington & Metcalf, 1979, p 133)

""There are many reasons, ideological, symbolic and social, why mortuary rites are central to Berawan religion and society. But it is not hard to see why they are utilized by leaders in order to make a statement about their own positions. Weddings and other rites of passage also provide an opportunity for community cooperation and conspicuous consumption. The Kenyah, close neighbours of the Berawan, employ name-giving ceremonies as their most important ritual of prestige. But the Kenyah have a more rigid system of prescribed rank than the Berawan, including endogamous class strata. For them it is possible to specify the status of a child in a way that is not for the Berawan ... the Berawan have no naming ceremonies comparable to Kenyah ones. They do appreciate the status implications of grand weddings. But when all the rice wine has been drunk, and the guests have shakily made their way home, what is there to keep a wedding in mind, to preserve it against the envious denigrations of rivals? The Berawan require something more concrete, and it is mortuary rites that provide it. Mausoleums are always built on the riverbank so that passersby can admire them and wonder at the power of their architects.

""At the outset, we noted that only people of high rank can command the support required to conduct a nulang or build a mausoleum. But we found it hard to define what rank is. We can now offer that definition by turning the original statement on its head. Berawan rank is, in part, the product of personal abilities: That person who can fuse the community together in coordinated action, that person is an aristocrat.""

'Birth and position: (Hau'ofa, 1981, pp. 184-214)

The Mekeo were divided into two territorial 'tribes', Pioufa and Ve'e. Ve'e was divided into two geographical divisions, Northern and Southern. Each tribe was divided into segmentary patrilineal descent groups. In the past there may have been two moieties (ngopu) within each tribe, but at the time of Hau'ofa's fieldwork this unit appears to have been recognised only among the Northern Ve'e. Descent groups of a lower order than the ngopu were called ikupu, a name given to dispersed clans, as well as to 'subclans' or localised branches of these clans. Villages were called pangua, and at least some of them consisted of 'wards' that were also called pangua:

“Mekeo includes two tribes, Pioufa and Ve’e. The latter is divided into two territorial units, Northern and Southern Ve'e, separated by the intervening territory of the Pioufa ... Seligmann (1910:327) wrote that each of the two tribes includes two ngopu groups. A ngopu consists of a number of pangua or clans claiming common patrilineal descent ... 'Each village consists of portions of a varying number of pangua (clans or local groups), representatives of each of which are found in few or many villages according to the strength and amount of dispersion of particular clans’ (Seligmann 1910:312). Within the localised branch of a clan are units called ikupu or 'family groups', branches of the pangua ... Most of my informants from the Pioufa tribe expressed complete ignorance of what a ngopu is, a clear indication of the fact that this tribal unit is no longer of significance among the Pioufa. The few, mostly elderly men, who know the term gave conflicting answers ... Among the Northern Ve’e there is no doubt that the ngopu as defined by Seligmann still exists and operates most conspicuously on ceremonial occasions ... [30] ... Of more relevance to the present chapter are Seligmann’s statements that pangua refers to clans, and ikupu to 'family groups' or lineages within the localised branches of clans. The word pangua, as used by the people today, has only territorial connotations, and certainly does not apply to a social unit as such. Whether it ever meant 'clan' is a moot point; I am inclined to think that it did not. Mekeo use the term variously to mean a 'village', a 'settlement', a 'residential section' or 'ward' within a village, or even a 'country' ... When people refer to clans and localised subclans they use the word ikupu ... [31] ... Lineages or ‘family
groups’ (in Seligmann’s usage) of a local branch of a clan are not necessarily referred to by the term ikupu—as Seligmann asserted —unless they have attained a certain degree of autonomy from the parent group ... In the remainder of this study 1 shall use the word pangua to mean 'village' or 'ward', and ikupu to refer to dispersed clans as well as to localised subclans (cf. Humphries 1923:223)."" (Hau'ofa, 1981, pp. 27-31)

Each ward appears to have been associated with a 'founding subclan' who retained political dominance, but often included 'affiliated' subclans: 

""The village comprises five named pangua or wards: Ongofo’ina,
Inaufokoa, Inau’i, Fopafo’ina and Aloaivea, each deriving its name from its founding ikupu or subclan."" (Hau'ofa, 1981, p. 34)

""These five subclans formed the nuclei of the five village wards. As the settlement grew, internal disputes precipitated the emigration of whole sections or smaller groups to other villages ... Those who left were replaced by other groups who had either been similarly pushed out from their own villages or had been in the area when the Pioufa first arrived. This is the explanation given by the villagers for the fact that all the wards of Beipa’a, with the single exception of Inaufokoa, are composed of more than one subclan (Table 2)."" (Hau'ofa, 1981, p. 36)

""The founding and dominant subclans of the village wards insist that their forefathers emigrated from the ancestral settlements of Isoisovapu and Isoisovina. This is true of most if not all Mekeo villages. The affiliated subclans, on the other hand, are mostly of non-Mekeo origin. It is probable that the migrants from the ancestral villages moved into the region between the Angabunga and Inawafunga Rivers and subjugated the small groups of people who were already there. This would explain in part the present dominant positions of the founding subclans and their chiefs over the affiliated subclans and their leaders."" (Hau'ofa, 1981, p. 39)

The largest group that had the potential to act as a unit was clearly the tribe. Pioufa functioned as a military alliance, but neither Ve'e nor either of its subgroups appears to have any unity. According to Hau'ofa, Pioufa lacked any 'formal tribal-wide organisation besides that of the military', which appears to have been a loose network rather than a hierarchical command structure. However, Hau'ofa also describes Pioufa as having had a 'most senior chief' (who may have received tribute), a 'principal python magician', and a 'head war magician'. 

""In the face of intertribal warfare, the long stability of the three main Pioufa villages was probably due to a large extent to their central locations, protected from outsiders by a ring of four small peripheral villages, Amoamo, Oriropetana, Inawae and Afa'i  ... Old men in these small villages said that in the precolonial past, when Pioufa was a more unified tribe, the peripheral villages acted as frontline outposts defending the main body of the tribe, three quarters of which lived in the three central villages ... Whether or not there was a deliberate, overall tribal defence plan in the location of its villages, the strategic location of the peripheral settlements are in themselves very significant ... [43] ... The position of the peripheral Pioufa villages was far from that of subservience to the central ones. The latter were dependent on them for their security and stability so could not afford to antagonise [44] them lest they emigrate elsewhere. The military interdependence between the peripheral and the central Pioufa villages was that facilitated by their proximity to each other ... Another factor which probably helped in maintaining an equitable balance between the central and the peripheral villages was that each of the small villages - except Afa'i about which I had no information - had mystical powers (or in one case, ceremonial position) superior to those of the central villages. The main chief of Oriropetana was, and still is, the most senior chief of all Pioufa. The present chief of that village once told me that in the past his forefathers received food tributes from distributions at feasts held in the villages of the entire tribe. Inawae had the third most senior sorcery lineage in the whole of Mekeo (the most senior sorcerers were from Bebeo, a small 'outpost' of Northern Ve'e). In Amoamo village lived the principal python magician in Pioufa ...  Although warfare was chronic, it is not the case that every tribe fought every other tribe all the time ... The wars fought by Mekeo at the onset of the colonial period were those among the Southern Ve'e villages themselves (BNG 1891-2:17) and between Amoamo and [the Northern Ve'e village of] Rarai ... [45] ... The forcible cessation of tribal warfare necessarily undermined the military authority, and although military leadership still survives it exists largely in a ceremonial sense. Furthermore, the cessation of warfare and threats of war removed the institution which provided the only formal organization for the whole Pioufa tribe, that is, the major military ceremonies and feasts. Apart from its territorial significance, the political importance of the tribe in the precolonial past lay in its military value: it was the largest territorial grouping for military co-operation and also the largest unit within which warfare was not supposed to be waged. There was no formal tribal-wide organisation besides that of the military. The largest group over which a Mekeo civilian chief had, and still has, primary authority is the ward. The military ceremonies involved large feasts which were for all the war chiefs of the tribe. These ceremonies maintained ties and obligations to be exploited when a group waging war needed assistance from others. The main civilian ceremonies, on the other hand, involved only a limited number of groups which constitute feasting and ceremonial dyads known as ufuapie ... With the abolition of warfare, military ceremonies ceased and with them the only tribal-wide ceremonial ties disappeared. The last military ceremony to be held in Beipa'a was in 1921 with the death of Foisau Aisama'a, the head [46] war magician of all Pioufa."" (Hau'ofa, 1981, pp. 42-46) 

At least two chiefly offices were associated with each independent subclan: that of pangua lopianga ('civilian chieftainship') and iso lopianga ('military chieftainship'). In larger subclans the civilian chieftainship was divided between a 'senior chief' (lopia fa'a) and a 'junior chief' (lopia eke). The senior chief in theory outranked both the 'war chief' and the 'junior chief'. In most villages, the senior chief of the 'founding subclan' was recognised as the chief of the whole village, though this role was 'largely ceremonial and symbolic', and the 'primary authority' of a senior chief was 'largely confined to his subclan or ward'. Presumably the authority of the 'most senior chief of all Pioufa' mentioned above (p. 43) was even more nominal:

""Since Seligmann’s description of Mekeo chieftainship is based on information collected in the early years of encounter with Europeans, I shall use a brief summary of it as the basis of my analysis. Seligmann (1910:342-8) stated that each subclan has or should have two leaders: a high chief, lopia fa’a, and a war chief, iso lopia, with the former ranking higher in authority than the latter. Many subclans are divided into two sections, fa ’aniau and eke'i, the headmen of the latter being officially called lopia eke'i. Seligmann offers no English translation for lopia eke'i who, he said, are henchmen and assistants of their superiors, the high chiefs ... As a rule high chiefs do not take active part in warfare unless their [185] villages are subjected to surprise nocturnal attacks. In ordinary fights they can stop hostilities by parading unarmed between the combatant lines shaking lime from their gourds ... The responsibility for all matters related to warfare rests on war chiefs who can have their own ufu [hall] for the performance of the functions pertaining to their office ... With the exception of Beipa’a, Aipiana and Rarai, each village in Pioufa and Northern Ve’e has a senior chief who is considered the head chief of the village. These are chiefs of subclans which founded their respective villages. The pre-eminence of the head chief of a village is largely ceremonial and symbolic, although a strong and resourceful head chief, like Vitolo Mainonga of Imounga, can use his position to become effectively dominant over the whole village (cf. MacGregor in BNG 1889-90:80; Stephen 1974). A senior chief’s primary authority, however, is largely confined to his subclan or ward."" (Hau’ofa, 1981, pp. 184-185)

""The distinction made by Seligmann between the ‘high chief’ and the ‘war chief’ needs clarification. Properly speaking, the more basic distinction is that between pangua lopianga, ‘chieftainship of the village’, and iso lopianga, ‘chieftainship of the spear’. This distinction refers to the fundamental division of authority in Mekeo society between the civilian and the military. In a fully grown subclan, the civilian chieftainship is divided between the lopia fa’a(niau) and the lopia eke (plural lopia eke’i). We have seen in Chapter 4 that the terms [185] fa ’aniau and eke mean ‘senior’ and ‘junior’ respectively. Henceforth, I shall use the terms ‘senior chiefs’ and ‘junior chiefs’ in reference to the holders of the top civilian offices. Seligmann’s use of the term ‘high chief’ is correct in so far as it indicates the higher ranking and authority of the senior over junior and war chiefs."" (Hau'ofa, 1981, pp. 184-185)

Among the Northern Ve'e (and possibly other Mekeo groups in the past), subclans living in different villages were organised in ngopu, and were to some extent subject to the authority of the 'chiefs of the senior branches of the ngopu':

""In late 1972 I went to a feast in the Northern Ve'e village of Imounga in which the whole population of the village was divided into two groups: those who had assisted the feast-giving subclan and those who arrayed themselves with the official guests. [30] Representatives of clans of other Northern Ve'e villages attended the feast and aligned themselves with one or the other group on the basis of their ngopu affiliations (the two ngopu being Kuapengi and Ngangai). The ngopu affiliations were, with one exception, exactly along the lines documented by Seligmann [sic]. Early in the same year I attended a feast for the installation of a new chief of Ngangai (Northern Ve'e) subclan in the Inawi (Pioufa) village. The feast was attended by the branches of the Ngangai ngopu from Northern Ve'e to oversee the preparations and the installation. The feast-giving chief told me that he could not install his successor without consultation with, and the actual presence of, the chiefs of the senior branches of the ngopu."" (Hau’ofa, 1981, pp. 27-30)

Altogether, it seems likely that effective political authority among the Mekeo was largely confined to the subclan, but could extend to the village or ngopu in at least some cases.","hauofa1981[26-48, 184-214]"

Settlement pattern was one of small hamlets grouped into 'districts' or 'villages'. No indication of any chiefs with a larger sphere of authority than the district/village. On Ulawa, chieftainship appears to have been limited to the hamlet. The village/district of Sa'a had a 'head chief', though the role of this figure is not quite clear. 

Role of chiefs in general:

“The chiefs were not allowed to go to battle. The role of the war leader was left to others … The main social function of the chiefs was the provision of feasts … They exercised no form of government in our sense of the term, though they inflicted punishment or levied a fine for the infringement of the tabu which they placed on anything. The behaviour of the community was regulated by an intuitive sense of what was right and proper, by what Dr Rivers calls ‘group-sentiment’ … Any lapses from the accepted standards, e.g. adultery and marriage within prohibited degrees, or theft among commoners, was dealt with either by the persons concerned or by the community generally without any reference to the chief.” (Ivens, 1927/1972, p 128)","ivens1972[22-54, 109-129]"

‘Chapter III. Domain and clan’ (pp. 120-187)

The island of Roti was divided into eighteen independent 'domains':

“Traditionally, Roti is further divided into 18 self-ruling domains called nusak. Each domain is governed by its own Lord who, together with the lords of the various clans that make up the kingdom, presides at a law court and makes decisions based upon the customary usage of his domain. Although borders have always been disputed, it is clear from information in the Dutch archives that most of these domains have existed as independent states for over 300 years.” (Fox, 1968, p 7)

Each domain (nusak) had a capital 'village' (nusak-lain) and was headed by a 'Lord' (manek) and a 'Head of the Earth' (dae langak). The Head of the Earth appears to have formally outranked the Lord, but the Lord held the majority of de facto power. Supreme religious authority was clearly in the hands of the Head of the Earth, while supreme secular authority appears to have been shared by the Lord and the Head of the Earth (the Lord could make legal and other important decisions, but the Head of the Earth had the right to veto them):

“Nusa(k), the word which I translate as 'domain’ in most contexts, has a number of interrelated meanings. First, the word can mean ‘island’ … Secondly, the word can refer to the independent political subdivisions of the island, the states which I describe as 'domains' … Another use of the word nusak, occurs in the expression, nusak lain, which is commonly shortened to simply nusak … Nusak lain, ‘high nusak’, is literally as well as figuratively the high point or centre of a domain.

Elsewhere describes Rotinese religious authority as having ‘never gone  beyond the clan’, which is odd considering the domain-level religious structure described above:

""Roti has no lunar calendar, and religious organization on the island has never gone beyond the clan, whose only major ritual was an annual harvest ceremony known as the hus or limba .... Furthermore, the Rotinese have no priesthood. Clans were represented by their titled court official and by the elders of the clan's lineage segments ... Traditionally each individual household made its own offerings to the ancestral spirits, so that on Roti, religion has had a far more individualized expression than on Savu.""

In the accounts of the battles between the atolls there is absolutely no mention of gods or spirits; a few spirit familiars are invoked in the stories of voyagers and warriors; and the spirits in the story of mutual theft have no human counterparts. However, once Fakaofo achieved pre-eminence Tui Tokelau, the great god of all Tokelau, becomes a presence and appears instantiated in a large stone erected in Fakaofo. In essence, Tui Tokelau is invoked with the estab-[137] lishment of the overarching polity of Tokelau itself, and is solidly positioned in Fakaofo where the paramount aliki was the god's principal supplicant and celebrant.

""Fakaofo overlords exacted tribute from Nukunonu as annual offerings to Tui Tokelau ... Fakaofo exercised pule 'political control/authority' over Nukunonu. All 'laws and regulations' were decreed from Fakaofo, and Fakaofo made appointments to positions of authority within Nukunonu and assigned Fakaofo men - specifically male descendants of Pio, the son of Nau - as deputies of the Fakaofo aliki there. Though civil affairs continued to be administered by Nukunonu's elders, they were constrained by Fakaofo authority, which in turn was sanctioned by Fakaofo's privileged access to Tui Tokelau, the source of fecundity and prosperity."" (Huntsman & Hooper, 1996, pp. 136-137)

“Tui Tokelau was all all-pervasive atua, a god whose being was beyond, in the sky or heavens. Newell (1895:606) wrote, ‘The story of the remarkable man Tuitokelau, who was deified as a great god, is … forever lost.’ More likely there never was a story, for no other source imagines Tui Tokelau as a man. The god was just there, instantiated in the huge stone enveloped in mats, standing outside the god-house in Fakaofo … Tui Tokelau was the ultimate cause and controller of good fortune and of the productivity and fruitfulness of the whole Tokelau world. The theme of life-giving productivity was central to the formulaic invocation of the god which was made on behalf of all Tokelau by the Fakaofo aliki … [151] … In addition to the prayer, offerings in appreciation of blessing and bounty were directed to Tui Tokelau when the god’s blessings were realised, particularly when there were abundant catches of fish … As well as regular offerings recognising the god’s beneficence, there was an annual ceremony in honour of Tui Tokelau when offerings were conveyed to Fakaofo from Nukunonu and Atafu, at which appears were made to the god for continuing prosperity.” (Huntsman & Hooper, 1996, pp. 150-151)

""In May every year the chief priest at Fakaofu set aside four weeks for the worship of Tui Tokelau and appointed emissaries to announce the time to the other islands ... [67] ... Many new mats, mother-of-pearl pendants, the unused halves of the shells made into bonito shanks, pandanus malo and coconut leaf skirts, and sennit braid were made and collected to send to Fakaofu as offerings.

‘Leaders and professionals’ (Handy, 1923, pp. 36-39)

Except on Ua Pou, political organization did not extended beyond the 'tribe'. 'Tribes' could have a unitary structure, or could have 'subdivisions', each of which had its own chief. Some tribes with 'subdivisions' also had a chief with authority over the tribe as a whole, whereas in other cases the subdivisions were independent. It is unclear how common each of these arrangements was.

“It has been pointed out that in some of the large valleys there were single great tribes with subdivisions, while in other places there was a number of unrelated tribes; that, beyond certain loose alliances there was no unity between different sections of islands and different valleys, and even that there was warfare within single valleys between related tribes. In other words, political organization in the Marquesas never went beyond the tribal stage.

“Every tribe had its chief. When some of the great tribes were subdivided, the subdivisions had each its own chief, who was entirely independent; in other tribes the chiefs of the subtribes were under the authority of the chief of the larger group ... 
It has already been pointed out that it was only on the island of Ua Pou that there was any approach to political unity on one island through dominance by a single chief: in other words, that this was the only island which had what might properly be called a king. It is my opinion, however, that it is unnecessary to dignify any chief in the Marquesas by the title, 'king,' for the political organization was always of the very simplest order, and the relationship of the haka-iki and his people was always that of a chief to his fellow-tribesmen, never approaching that of a king to subjects."" (Handy, 1923, p. 35)

'Community structures' (Handy, 1923, pp. 42-44)

The settlement pattern in the Marquesas was dispersed. The closest thing to a 'local community' appears to have been the 'tribe' or 'subtribe':

""Dwellings were not concentrated in villages but scattered throughout the length of the valley, or, in a few bays, along the shore. There seems to [43] have been little tendency toward the formation of village communities. Private establishments consisted of a large sleeping house on a stone platform, a cook house near-by, a sacred house for old men, a house for storing food, and in the near vicinity a sacred place. The chief's establishment was the community center. It included his sleeping house, which was larger and more elaborate than most private dwellings and was built on a stone platform; his cook house, storage house, the dwellings of his attendants on stone platforms; a warriors' house, also on a stone platform; a paved dance area, on which were sometimes special houses for canoes, for the preparation of feasts, or the like, with surrounding platforms for spectators, on which were erected temporary structures at the times of rites and festivals; ovens; a temple, which was usually associated with this feast place and with the chief's establishment; and a vai ke'etu, an enclosed, fresh-water basin made of cut, red stone slabs, reserved as the sacred bathing place of the chief's eldest son. In secluded and usually elevated locations there were other sacred places (me'ae), which also belonged to the chief and served for tribal ceremonial and burial."" (Handy, 1923, p. 42)

‘Priests’ (Handy, 1923, pp. 223-230)

Religious organization, like political organization, does not as a rule appear to have extended beyond the tribe:

“The tribal inspirational priest was called tau'a, tau'a nui, or sometimes atua, which means literally god. The tau'a, who filled the rôle of tribal inspirational priests, must be distinguished from those of less prominence, called by the same name, who were private practitioners. Tau'a was a term which referred to all persons who were subject to possession by spirits or gods.
“After the tribal inspirational priest, the next in importance in tribal worship was the ceremonial priest, tuhuna o'ono (tuhika o'oko), who may be characterized also as the tribal bard and director of ritual, since it was he who led, and at times sang alone, the sacred chants in rites. He was also the teacher of chants and legends.

“Moa, u'u, or taputoho were men who were the guardians and assistants of the inspirational priest and consecrated to the work of serving as assistants in ceremonial. Tauoha, veveahu, or tauahi were servants of the inspirational priest.

“Tuhuna as a class, including the ‘old men’ who were masters of different professions, constituted a body that furnished the choirs which intoned the sacred chants during the ceremonials in the sacred places and on the feast places. Each of the above classes of religious functionaries will be discussed separately. Each tribal temple of importance had one inspirational priest, several ceremonial priests, and a considerable number of assistants.” (Handy, 1923, p. 223)

However, according to Thomas (1990), some tau'a were recognized over much larger areas than any chief:

""The importance of tau'a is undelrined by the fact that, while evidence for any supralocal authority in the early contact period (except on 'Ua Pou) is lacking, the potency of some tau'a was clearly recognized in more than one valley: that of Tamapuameini was acknowledged over a whole island. There thus seems to have been a crude difference between the renown of certain shamans and that of any chief."" (Thomas, 1990, p 36)",thomas1990[36]

18945,mekeo,85,2,151-2,"'Visible authority and invisible powers' (Hau'ofa, 1981, pp. 215-288)

Mekeo supernatural beliefs centred on isapu, something like 'magical power':

“Underlying all positions of authority and all important activities in Mekeo society is the phenomenon of power, isapu, and the knowledge and skill in applying it to nature and to man. Isapu, which literally means ‘heat’, is ritual and magical in character. No activity of any significance can be successful without the knowledge and practice of the particular power associated with it.” (Hau’ofa, 1981, p. 215)

Harmful forms of isapu were believed to be more powerful than beneficent ones, making practitioners of black magic particularly important. There were four principal leadership offices in Mekeo society: 'civilian chief', 'sorcerer', 'war chief', and 'war magician'. Civilian chiefs and war chiefs were considered 'good' and hence were not able to use malevolent magic legitimately, unlike sorcerers and war magicians, who were considered 'bad':

“It follows from this that the traditional leadership offices of war chiefs, war magicians, civilian chiefs, and sorcerers, are offices with powers stronger than those of ordinary people. We have seen that through the seniority system eldest sons (and thus hereditary leaders) inherit, as a rule, the most important magical powers of their fathers. I return to this point below.” (Hau'ofa, 1981, p. 216)

“The division between the civilian and military leadership, as we have seen, is perceived in moral terms as being that of separating powers which are predominantly bad and powers which are essentially good. But true to the logic of the two-sided moral evaluation of things, the military is also good, and the civilian is also bad. This moral ambivalence is evidence in a further subdivision within each of the two fields of leadership. These subdivisions may be seen as attempts to resolve the ambivalence by separating further still the good and the bad powers. In the military sphere, the war chief represents the relatively good and less dangerous powers; he operates in the open as the leader of war parties and conducted of public ceremonies and rituals related to warfare. The war magician represents the bad aspects; he operates in secrecy in the darkness of night, and is in possession of the most dangerous powers associated with warfare … In the civilian sphere, the good is projected onto the office and person of the civilian chief, and the bad and dangerous are personified by the sorcerer, who is the power behind the chief and is the chief’s execu- [218] tioner. The sorcerer is to the civilian chief as the war magician is to the war chief.

“This introduces us to another important consideration of isapu. There are different kinds of isapu with varying degrees of potency ranging from the ordinary and universally distributed to the most potent and exclusive. Intrinsic to the potency of powers is the degree of danger associated with them, so that the most potent are also the most dangerous, fearsome and evil. War magic and sorcery are the most potent powers of all, so it is not surprising that they are parts of the military and the civilian orders of leadership. Traditional authority in Mekeo rests on mystical powers of the most dangerous kinds, and succession to hereditary offices of leadership is, in the final analysis, accession to positions of isapu.

“Finally, I suggested in Chapter 7 that junior members of sub-clans, taking advantage of their proven skill and success as warriors, wrested control of the dangerous military powers from their seniors. Mekeo say that war magicians descend from junior lines of warrior groups … Similarly, in the civilian sphere, it can be said that sorcerers who, as we shall see below, are descendants of junior agnates, took from their seniors of from other sources the dangerous powers of sorcery. Mekeo say that because it is desirable that elder brothers be good men, the more dangerous powers (war magic and sorcery) in their offices were transferred to their younger brothers whom people did not expect to behave like chiefs. This does not preclude another probable explanation … which is that junior agnates acquired [219] these powers through devious means including theft … All this suggests that in the processes of segmentation and fission in agnatic groups junior members achieved their autonomy and official recognition for their leaders by acquiring powers stronger and more dangerous than those of their seniors. Their very success, even at times to the extent of dominating the affairs of their subclans, suggests that this was the case. This may be what Mekeo mean when they say that this or that senior chief has only the name and prestige of his office while the real power of the subclan is in the hands of a junior agnate … Ultimately, the expectations built into the roles of seniors as men of peace, conciliators, and paragons of virtue, limit the kinds of isapu that chiefs can hold. Not being circumscribed by such expectations, junior members are in an advantageous position to acquire strong, dangerous, and bad powers which they can use to assert their independence and even dominance.” (Hau'ofa, 1981, pp. 217-219)

Formally, chiefs outranked sorcerers and war magicians and could not act independently of them (see above), but it appears that the latter were sometimes more powerful. They may also have had wider spheres of authority. Whereas the authority of a 'civilian chief' (lopia fa'a) never extended beyond the village, the Pioufa tribe is described as having had a 'head war magician':

""In the face of intertribal warfare, the long stability of the three main Pioufa villages was probably due to a large extent to their central locations, protected from outsiders by a ring of four small peripheral villages, Amoamo, Oriropetana, Inawae and Afa'i  ... Old men in these small villages said that in the precolonial past, when Pioufa was a more unified tribe, the peripheral villages acted as frontline outposts defending the main body of the tribe, three quarters of which lived in the three central villages ... Whether or not there was a deliberate, overall tribal defence plan in the location of its villages, the strategic location of the peripheral settlements are in themselves very significant ... [43] ... The position of the peripheral Pioufa villages was far from that of subservience to the central ones. The latter were dependent on them for their security and stability so could not afford to antagonise [44] them lest they emigrate elsewhere. The military independence between the peripheral and the central Pioufa villages was that facilitated by their proximity to each other ... Another factor which probably helped in maintaining an equitable balance between the central and the peripheral villages was that each of the small villages - except Afa'i about which I had no information - had mystical powers (or in one case, ceremonial position) superior to those of the central villages. The main chief or Oriropetana was, and still is, the most senior chief of all Pioufa. The present chief of that village once told me that in the past his forefathers received food tributes from distributions at feasts held in the villages of the entire tribe. Inawae had the third most senior sorcery lineage in the whole of Mekeo (the most senior sorcerers were from Bebeo, a small 'outpost' of Northern Ve'e. In Amoamo village lived the principal python magician in Pioufa ...  [45] ... The forcible cessation of tribal warfare necessarily undermined the military authority, and although military leadership still survives it exists largely in a ceremonial sense. Furthermore, the cessation of warfare and threats of war removed the institution which provided the only formal organization for the whole Pioufa tribe, that is, the major military ceremonies and feasts ... There was no formal tribal-wide organisation besides that of the military. The largest group over which a Mekeo civilian chief had, and still has, primary authority is the ward. The military ceremonies involved large feasts which were for all the war chiefs of the tribe. These ceremonies maintained ties and obligations to be exploited when a group waging war needed assistance from others. The main civilian ceremonies, on the other hand, involved only a limited number of groups which constitute feasting and ceremonial dyads known as ufuapie ... With the abolition of warfare, military ceremonies ceased and with them the only tribal-wide ceremonial ties disappeared. The last military ceremony to be held in Beipa'a was in 1921 with the death of Foisau Aisama'a, the head [46] war magician of all Pioufa."" (Hau'ofa, 1981, pp. 42-46) 

""Since Seligmann's description of Mekeo chieftainship is based on information collected in the early years of encounter with Europeans, I shall use a brief summary of it as the basis of my analysis. Seligman (1910:342-8) stated that each subclan has or should have two leaders, a high chief, lopia fa'a, and a war chief, iso lopia, with the former ranking higher in authority than the latter ... With the exception of Beipa’a, Aipiana and Rarai, each village in Pioufa and Northern Ve’e has a senior chief who is considered the head chief of the village. These are chiefs of subclans which founded their respective villages. The pre-eminence of the head chief of a villages is largely ceremonial and symbolic, although a strong and resourceful head chief … can use his position to become effectively dominant over the whole village ... A senior chief’s primary authority, however, is largely confined to his subclan or ward."" (Hau’ofa, 1981, pp. 184-185)

“In replying to questions about the structure of civilian leadership, Mekeo willingly make statements in accordance with the ideas they hold. They tell the inquirer that the chiefs are backed by sorcerers …. When someone becomes a nuisance or a public menace, the chief instructs his sorcerer to discipline or kill him. The sorcerer does not attack anyone unless instructed or permitted by the chief … This is a legitimate function of sorcerers and although the immediate relatives of the victims may dispute the justice of measures taken against them, most people will admit that chiefs and sorcerers have tasks to do however unpleasant they may be.” (Hau'ofa, 1981, p. 250)

""A conspicuous aspect of sorcery in Mekeo is the nominal subordination of sorcerers to chiefs ... The lower ranking and nominal subordination of sorcerers to chiefs arises from their being the junior agnates of the latter."" (Hau'ofa, 1981, p. 297)","hauofa1981[42-46, 215-288, 297]"

“The office of sovereign in Madagascar, though main- tained with considerable pomp and barbaric splendour, has no common measure of toils, anxieties, and difficulties. The monarch may consult with whom he pleases ; and he is in the habit of assembling his people under the pretext [346] of consulting them, and laying before them plans — from which, however, they never dissent — but the final responsibility of the affairs of government rests with himself. He is the father of his kingdom, and its numerous and diversified officers are under his independent control. He is invested with the legislative and executive authority. All laws emanate from him. The army is raised, and its officers are appointed by him. Peace and war are made by him. All important civil cases are finally decided by him ; and death can be inflicted or remitted only by his decree. In some instances he goes out to war in person, and then takes as a right the command of the army.” (Ellis, 1838A, pp. 345-346)

“The greatest national council in Madagascar is an assembly of the people of the capital, and the heads of the provinces, districts, towns, villages, &c. These are held in Andohalo : Radama usually presided in person, taking his place on a platform on an elevated spot situated near the centre … [379] …The next council to this was the assembly of the heads of provinces, districts, and towns only, when the judges and military officers were deputed as the king's commissioners, to make known his will; and the judges carried back to the king the opinion of the assembly, again receiving orders from the king, which they were to make known to those over whom each presided. After the formation of a dis- ciplined army, however, these councils of the nation became less frequent, and are now mere matters of form.” (Ellis, 1838A, pp. 378-379)

“As the country is divided into provinces, districts, &c, there is, belonging to each, a principal town or village, in which stands a government-house, called Lapa, and opposite to this house is a sacred stone, by the side of which sacrifices are offered. In each of these towns or villages are appointed ten farantsa, or magistrates, whose office is to govern the district, arrest transgressors, execute the king's orders, take care that the tenth of the produce is gathered [381] in taxes, and to decide in judgment between contending parties. But if they are unable to adjust such differences, the action must be brought before the judges at the capital, and from that court there is no appeal. The farantsa perform nearly the same duties in the country as those at the capital, acting both as magistrates and judges. Under them again are the Loholana, or the heads of the villages in a district.” (Ellis, 1838A, pp. 380-381)",ellis1838A[341-346]

‘The ceremonies’ (Cole & Gale, 1922, pp. 315-358)

'Social organization. Government. The village' (Cole & Gale, 1922, pp. 359-370)

The only specifically religious specialists mentioned in Cole & Gale (1922, pp 295-358) are spirit mediums, who were usually older women. There is no indication that these specialists had secular power, or even special status. However, the role of headman (lakay) had some religious elements. The lakay was expected to be 'well-versed in the customs of the ancestors', which were 'closely interwoven' with religion. The lakay also had the power to decide when a certain religious ceremony (sagobay) was held, and to organize provisions for it, though the lakay does not appear to have played an active role in the ceremony itself.

“Custom and religion have become so closely interwoven in this society that it is well-nigh impossible to separate them. The building of a house, the planting, harvesting and care of the rice, the procedure at a birth, wedding, or funeral, in short, all the events of the social and economic life, and so governed by custom and religious beliefs, that it is safe to say that nearly every act in the life of the Tinguian is directed or affected by these forces.” (Cole & Gale, 1922, p 296).  

“SAGOBAY ... When an epidemic appears in a nearby settlement, the lakay summons the old men in council, and they decide on the number of pigs, and the amount of rice, basi, and other articles required, after which the necessary funds are secured by levying a tax on all the people of the village
 
“To keep the evil spirits, who bear the sickness, out of the town, a cord of bamboo or rattan is stretched around the whole settlement, while at the gate a high fence is erected. Through the uprights of this fence are stuck bamboo spikes with the sharpened ends facing [325] outward, so as to catch or pierce the intruders (Plate XXVIII) ; while in the saloko and along the gateway are placed leaves, roots, and other offerings acceptable to the friendly spirits. Similar cords and leaves are also strung around the entrances to the houses.

""The cord and gateway form an adequate protection, and no human being or spirit will violate this taboo. Should a human do so, the least penalty would be a tax sufficient to pay all the expense of the ceremony; but should the sickness afterwards invade the town, it is quite possible that more serious punishment might be exacted by the families of the victims.
When all is prepared, the men and boys arm themselves, and with shouts and hostile demonstrations drive the sickness toward the town whence it is thought to come. Returning to the center of the village, the people dance tadek, and the mediums may summon several spirits.” (Cole & Gale, 1922, pp. 324-325)

""The lakay is supposed to be well versed in the customs of the ancestors, and all matters of dispute or questions of policy are brought to him…"" (Cole & Gale 1922 p. 359)",cole-gale1922[295-370]

Moreover, in the case of a headman of a village or walak, the degree of real power was limited. This was already evident in the priocess of decision-making as described by Padtburgge. The over-rigter (presumably the head of the walak) summoned, via the uitroper (a sort of caller), ‘all other headmen and all the village folk’ for a meeting. There, the headmen discussed the issues … ‘The peasants and the common men, after the headmen, also take the questions into consideration and deliberation, and the affair is decided on by a majority vote, without respect of persons.” (Schouten, 1998, pp 35-36)",schouten1998[11-38]

'Religious offices and roles' (Monberg, 1991, pp. 175-217)

Bellona society was divided into nested patrilineal descent groups: clans (sa'a), subclans or 'alliance groups' (kakai'anga), and lineages (manaha). Lineages consisted of a number of 'homesteads' or 'households', also called manaha. Territorially, the island was divided into three 'districts' (kanomanaha). There were two clans, which were localized, as were their subclans to a large extent. One clan (Taupongi or Iho), which was also a subclan, occupied one district. The other clan (Kaitu'u) occupied the other two districts. One of these districts (Matangi) was occupied by a single subclan, and the other (Ghongau) was divided among two subclans. Lineages were only partially localised within a district:

""There were 440 inhabitants in 82 settlements on Bellona immediately before the introduction of Christianity. They represented generations 20 to 23 of the immigrants to Bellona from the traditional homeland 'Ubea, according to their oral traditions ... The major social divisions were those of clans (sa'a), subclans (kakai'anga), and patrilineal descent groups (manaha).

[9]

""There were two clans on Bellona, sa’a Kaitu’u and sa’a Taupongi ... Themembers of the Kaitu'u clan claimed to be descendants of one of the first immigrants, Kaitu'u, and the members of the Taupongi clan claimed descent from another immigrant, Taupongi ... These clans were the major patrilineal descent groups of the island and were also residential units ... Male members of the Taupongi clan call owned land and resided in the same district (kanomanaha), Ngango, at the western end of the island. This clan was commonly called the Iho clan after one of its first ancestors ... and this is the term used throughout this book. Male members of the Kaitu'u cla owned land and resided in the middle district, Ghonghau, and in the eastern district, Matangi.

""Male landowners residing in the same district considered themselves to belong to a kakai’anga, a term indicating the largest alliance group of a clan. Its members all traced patrilineal ascent to an ancestor of a later generation than that of the first immigrants ... The separation of male members of the Kaitu'u clan at Ghongau and Matangi was rationalized by the Bellonese by reference to specific 'historic' traditions that related how the Kaitu'u clan had divided, resulting in the creation of two kakai'anga residing in and controlling different areas. In generation 17-18 Ghonghau district had split into two alliance groups, Tengutangabangka'ango and Tengutangabangitakungu ... which were considered separare kakai'anga by some Bellonese. The rift is so recent that there is still disagreement whether these two alliance groups should be called separate social units. Their members still live intermingled in the same area, and it is impossible to draw a borderline between the areas controlled by their respective people. The people of the Iho clan considered themselves one kakai'anga, and the district ihabited by them was a kanomanaha ... In 1938 the Bellonese recognised three distinct districts (kanomanaha): Ngango, owned by by the Iho clan; Ghongau, owned by a subclan of the Kaitu'u clan that was on the verge of splitting into two distinct subclan; and Matangi, owned by another subclan of the Kaitu'u clan.

""The subclans were further subdivided into minor patrilineal descent groups, manaha. (In this book the word lineage is used synonymously with the term patrilineal descent group) ... [10] ... Land belonging to the members of a manaha often formed a cluster of garden areas and homesteads, but some of the land owned by members of the same patrilineal descent group was dispersed. The result was that land owned by different lineages was intermingled within a district."" (Monberg, 1991, pp. 8-10)

""A lineage was subdivided into a number of households. The term for household is the same as that for lineage, namely manaha. Manaha also means an important land area. A lineage derived its name from the most prominent homestead and land area belonging to one of its members, namely that owned by the first man to branch off from his original lineage to form a new patrilineal descent group. This homestead and land area was called a hakanohonga … A man might own land and built his living houses in various parts of the district of his subclan, where he lived with his household. This usually consisted of the nuclear family, often with one or more kinsmen living with them for shorter or longer periods."" (Monberg, 1991, p. 13)

The most important religious office was clearly the ‘priest chief’ (tunihenua). Holding this title appears to have been a requirement in order to ‘lead rituals’. Most households were headed by a priest-chief. There does not appear to have been any formal hierarchy among priest-chiefs, though some were more ‘prominent’ than others:

""Three types of offices existed: assistants to priests (hakabaka), second priest-chiefs (haihenua), and priest-chiefs (tunihenua). Each of these office-holders were assigned specific roles.""(Monberg, 1991, p 175)

""By being appointed priest-chief a man became a key figure in the ritual system. Most adult landowners carried the title and could thus lead their own rituals."" (Monberg, 1991, p 190)

""Attainment of priesthood is not easily separated from social status. Some priest-chiefs were prominent, others less so.""(Monberg, 1991, p. 373)

Priest-chiefs usually confined their activity to their lineages, but could officiate for different lineages within the same clan and district. The largest-scale rituals appear to have been performed by lineages. 

""Priest-chiefs of high skill performed elaborate rituals with quite large distributions of food and also acted as priest chiefs when invited by other homesteads or even other patrilineages. Less skilled priest-chiefs usually limited themselves to conducting smaller household rituals and would often add their harvest produce to that of others and join in their larger rites."" (Monberg, 1991, pp 201-210)

""The Bellonese asserted that members of a lineage most often acted as religious officials at each other’s rituals. But if there were too few adult men in a lineage, they might turn to others for help … No one could act as priest-chief at ritual feasts of people of another clan. Members of the Taupongi (Iho) clan could not assume any roles in rituals of the Kaitu’u clan because these clans worshipped different sets of district deities. However, there are a few examples of members of the Kaitu’u clan making ritual distributions in Ngango district of the Taupongi clan, but in those cases they invoked their own deities, not those of the Taupongi people."" (Monberg, 1991, p 211)

""The ritual donors in any specific ritual cycle were usually one or more men of the same patrilineal descent group. No cases are known in which men of lineage A added their crop to a ritual feast for lineage B, but there were several cases in which a man acted as religious official at the rituals of another lineage, often to help a lineage that had no adult, initiated priest-chief at a certain time, or that lacked persons who could act as godly vehicle or second priest-chief. A person would never act as religious official in a district other than his own, because districts worshipped different deities and ancestors.""

Tricky. On the one hand, Loeb describes the Mentawai as lacking 'true chiefs, laws, or government'. A figure called the rimata existed, but such political power as he possessed was clearly an indirect result of his religious authority - he controlled the timing of various activities by performing or not performing the rituals that were believed to be essential for their success:

On the other hand, one village, Taikako, is described as having exercised a kind of hegemony over the whole of the Pagai group. How this hegemony was maintained is unclear, given that centralized authority was lacking at the village level, or indeed at any level:

""Each village consists of one or more uma (communal house) and the surrounded lalep (family houses).

""Nguna is divided today into a number of ‘dominions’ (this word being the translation of namarakiana which denotes ‘that which. is ruled or led’, each of which is an area defined by common boundaries that it shares with. its neighbouring dominions … [39] ... The ‘village’ as we know it today - a highly nucleated aggregation of dwellings inhabited by people of whom many are not consanguineally related to each other - had not yet come into existence in the 19th century. Today dominions and villages are in a one-to-one relationship, so that one may cite one village and thereby imply the entire area to which its members lay claim. This was not true in the past ... Within any given dominion there were once various numbers of dispersed hamlets or villages, each composed of smaller groups of houses ·inhabited by extended families. Guiart (1973: 3381. describes each such cluster of houses, called varea, as a patrilineal, patrilocal unit. My own investigations indicate that this was a residential rather than a descent unit."" (Facey, 1982, pp. 38-39)

""The political norm within a dominion was cooperation with a strong sense of identification ... Contrasting sharply with this: intra-dominion ethos was inter-dominion hostility ... [42] ... Guiart describes the traditional political system as ‘hierarchical’ (ibid:408). In each varea only one man was designated by the term nawota which is translated as ‘chief’ ... He was considered titular ownerof that varea's men's house and dancing-ground. Several other men in each varea bore titles, too, but theirs were of a lower order than that of the chief. The entire area defined as a ‘dominion’ was presided over by one of the chiefs who, in contrast to all the other varea-chiefs (or ‘small’ chiefs) was known as the ‘big’ or ‘high’ chief ... Of these various title-holders only the latter, in any given dominion, would be involved in such relationships with. men of other dominions or even other islands.” (Facey, 1982, pp. 41-42) 

“Duties of the chief concerned dominion-welfare: war-making; peace-making; resource-management (through the application of taboos to certain crops or areas to ensure a sufficiency for special feastsl; and the appropriate allotment of land for everyday gardening needs throughout his dominion.

“Everything in his dominion, including the people, was the chief's. Periodically tokens were presented to him by each. household declaring precise. numbers and kinds of pigs, yams, kava and mats which. were his to command. He would then be able to decide how he might best utilize these resources in political display and exchange, particularly on the inter-dominion level. In the meantime, his people stored or, in the case of livestock, continued to care for their pledged contributions until the chief should need them.” (Facey, 1982, p. 48)

""So far I have spoken of ‘small’ and ‘big’ or ‘high’ chiefs; but one ‘higher’ than these is in existence today. He is the grandson of Matokoaale to whom Milne referred many times as ‘head-chief’ [53] of Tanoropo and as the ‘highest chief on Nguna’. Matokoaale is said to have been a descendant of a supernatural female being who was captured on Efate and married to a man of Siviri village on the North coast of Efate. This quasi-woman had two sons, one of whom crossed to Nguna and was given land and a people to rule by chief Masekaau of Raitoa [see Appendix II). In due time this newcomer, whose chiefly name was Taripoaliu, became high chief over that whole dominion as well as four others. He initiated the slaughter of an unheard-of number of pigs – 1,000 - at his investiture, earning the name ‘head of a thousand’ (napau ni manu}. Thereafter at the investiture of other ‘big’ chiefs within his newly-created realm 50 rather than 100 pigs were sacrificed.

“This is said to have taken place many generations ago. Matokoaale held this. position in 1870, but the chiefly name, Taripoaliu, had already been officially passed to another man … Although the origin of the first Taripoaliu and the line of descent linking Matokoaale with him remain relatively obscure, it is clear that Matokoaale was more powerful than the other ‘high chiefs’ with whom he was allied.Milne cites an incident in which Matokoaale had the high chief, Masekaau [also known as Masikailapalapal, killed. [54] In Milne’s words this was
“’…[for] becoming rich and ambitious. He owned many pigs and he wore very broad armlets and, in his arrogant belief that no one dare interfere, he had misconducted himself with the wife of a Tanoropo man.’ (In Don 1927: 151)

“Parsonson's research further illuminates this event. He has suggested (per letter: Dec. 5, 1980) that Masekaau was ‘... a high chief in his own right, if not sometime head of one of the confederacies on the island’. Moreover, he adds this crucial bit of information: the heir to the murdered Masekaau made claim to the title of Taripoaliu in 1936 and the then incumbent (Suasavil) Taripoaliu offered to stand down in his favour. This was never effected, but it strongly indicates that the murder of Masekaau was not a jural act to punish sexual ‘misconduct’, as Milne interpreted it. It was, rather, the calculated removal of a real or potential rival to Matokoaale. Matokoaale was able to maintain his position thereafter, but Parsonson points out that he left soon after that incident to teach on Emae. This does not sustain the image of a man in a supreme position, a ‘paramount chief’. It has more the character of a flight from retribution on the part of a ‘big man’ who has overstepped his authority and fears that his own life may be in jeopardy.” (Facey, 1982, pp. 52-54)",facey-1982[38-54]

""Manihiki and Rakahanga, atolls 25 miles apart, are occupied by a people sprung from one family of settlers. The whole population once lived on one atoll at a time and moved back and forth from one atoll to the other when forced to do so by depletions of the coconut and puraka (species of taro) supplies"" (Buck, 1932, p. 4)

There was one village on Rakahanga and two on Manihiki:

""Manihiki is the larger of the two atolls and contains about 1,250 acres of land. It has a fine lagoon abounding in pearl shell and Tridacna, but there are no large natural passages through the reef. The boat passages opposite the two villages are short and boats or canoes must be run up onto the reef, from which they are dragged to the deeper water on the inner side of the reef flat … [5] … Rakahanga, with an area of 1,000 acres, is smaller than Manihiki …The small island, Te Kainga, in the southwest, was the original home of the people, but the site of the single village was changed to Rakahanga across the inter-island channel to the south."" (Buck, 1932, pp. 4-5)

‘Titular system’ (Buck, 1932, pp. 43-56)

‘Tribal history’ (Buck, 1932, pp. 57-65)

The entire population formed a loosely-knit political community. There were four 'tribes' (matakeinanga) that were largely independent and were each headed by a whakamaru. The tribes were grouped into pairs under an ariki, whose role was mostly religious. All four tribes cooperated during migrations between the atolls:

""Each matakeinanga elected its head independently of the others. The special term whakamaru was coined to distinguish him. His powers have been defined. For practical purposes, the matakeinanga was a small tribe, independent of the others as regards local government, but uniting with another matakeinanga under the two priestly ariki for religious purposes. All four matakeinanga federated for voyages back and forth between Mani-hiki and Rakahanga."" (Buck, 1932, p. 60)

The two ariki were called Whainga-aitu and Whakaheo. Their roles were complementary:

""The opposing factions were pacified by a compromise, for the native historians state that in the period of Temu-matua and Tianewa-matua the authority (pohatu) was divided (I to raua tuatau i ngaha te pohatu). The compromise was the creation of a dual arikiship. Temu-matua was made an ariki and was the first to hold the Whainga-aitu title. Tianewa-matua was made an ariki and was the first to hold the Whakaheo title.

“The people also divided into four tribes, and two tribes supported each title. The old tribes, Numatua and Tia-ngaro-tonga, upheld the Whakaheo title. Two newly-created tribes, Heahiro and Mokopuwai, banded together under the leadership of the Whainga-aitu ...  The lands in both Rakahanga and Manihiki became divided among the tribes. The dual ariki ruled over their respective tribes, with evidently no serious friction, as there are no traditional records of local wars. The ariki were supported by their hui rangatira (assembly of chiefs), which included the special officers dealing with land and food, and the heads of subtribes. There was some differentiation in the powers of the two ariki. (See p. 210.) The dual arikiship existed down to the advent of Christianity, when the offices gradually fell into abeyance owing to changed conditions affecting the social structure of the people."" (Buck, 1932, p. 48)

Both ariki roles appear to have been almost exclusively religious:

“The Whainga-aitu title was a full ariki title, but the special term must have been developed locally, for it does not appear, so far as I know, in any other part of Polynesia. The term is said to be derived from the words whai (to follow), nga (the), and aitu (gods). The title thus stresses the priestly functions of the office, for the Whainga-aitu was the principal medium between his people and the gods ...[49] … He ruled over the two tribes, Heahiro and Mokopuwai, but did not interfere in the sharing out of land, which was left to the tribal heads, or whakamaru. The Whainga-aitu was the spiritual head and could command the assistance of the supernormal powers that commanded the productivity of land and sea. The whakamaru were the executives who superintended economic details."" (Buck, 1932, pp. 48-49)

“The term Whakaheo is said to be derived from waka (canoe) and heo (to surround). In the voyages made by the whole population between the two atolls, the ariki holding the title surrounded the canoes with his priestly and supernormal powers and thus insured safe transport ... The Whakaheo had power over the phenomena of nature. He could demonstrate his power by causing the lightning to flash, the thunder to sound, and the rain to fall. He thus controlled the winds and storms, and it was through this power that he was able to surround the voyaging canoes with his priestly protection and insure a safe passage between the atolls.” (Buck, 132, p. 52)

Each ariki was assisted by an 'assembly of chiefs', whose role is not quite clear, as well as 'certain chiefs who had to deal with the economic details within the tribes', about which little is said. The whakamaru were probably the heads of the four tribes. One among them, the moa, was senior and could overrule the others. The moa was 'associated with the Whainga-aitu', but it is not clear that he was under his direct control:

""It was held that each ariki had his hui rangatira (assembly of chiefs). The term hui rangatira is a Rarotongan one which includes the heads of families who are closely related to the ruling ariki ... Associated with the ariki were certain chiefs who had to deal with the economic details within the tribes ... Whakamaru was the local taohanga (title) given to the heads of tribes ... Whakamaru (to give shelter or shade) is thus an expressive term, as the head of the tribe [55] sought to shelter his people. According to some informants, there were two whakamaru under each of the dual ariki, thus making one representative for each of the four tribes. Others seemed to think that the heads of subtribes were also whakamaru. Some of the subtribes must have been fairly small in number, and it is hardly likely that the term would have been applied to the heads of many subtribes ... The duties of the whakamaru were to act as public custodian over tribal lands, to settle disputes, and to prevent outside interference from another tribe. He had to do with directing the planting of food crops and the protection of the coconut plantations and puraka swamps from theft. He had power also over the redistribution of tribal lands which had to be adjusted to the ebb and flow of population. His decision was final, and not even his ariki could interfere with him in matters that concerned the interior economy of the tribe. His status was as high or even higher than that of the ariki in local matters. When it came to questions which concerned the intervention of the tribal gods, however, the ariki was superior, owing to his special priestly functions. From a modern point of view, the whakamaru in his own tribal district was judge of the native land court, Crown ranger, and director of agriculture. He also had a priestly function. When the whole population crossed from one atoll to the other the whakamaru from the tribes went first to the marae to conduct the appropriate ritual to the god (ka whai i to ratou atua). It was also stated that certain lesser tribal gods were in the keeping of the whakamaru.

“The moa was a speaker or messenger between the whakamaru and the ariki. He was a whakamaru appointed by whakamaru. In discussions among the whakamaru he assumed seniority, and his decision was final. The title-holder seemed to be associated particularly with the Whainga-aitu."" (Buck, 1942, pp. 54-55)

Another figure whose authority apparently encompassed the whole population was the papa, whose role was religious and economic:

“The papa was a special title held by one Tuteru-te-tahua. He dealt with economic matters with which the ariki, by virtue of his priestly position, was not allowed to concern himself. He thus controlled land and food supplies. He had power with the Whainga-aitu division through his father and power with the Whakaheo division through his mother. He could thus conduct the religious ritual at the Poutu marae at Tauhunu and at the Akaroa marae at Tukou. He probably was a super whakamaru who by birth and ability carried influence with the whakamaru of the four tribes.” (Buck, 1932, p. 56)","buck1932a[4, 43-65]"

“The naleoana was, in essence, an exchange of gifts, in food and pigs, between visiting villages and the host village of a particular dominion. They took place with considerable frequency, if not regularity, and were mandatory on the occasion of a marriage and at specified intervals throughout the period of mourning following a death. In order to carry one off the chief in charge had to activate relationships in which he was ‘dominant’ as well as [44] utilizing the produce of specific plots. of land set aside for this unique use within his own dominion. The explicit purpose of these feasts, however, was not the glorification of the host chief himself, but rather the appeasement of the spirits of the dead ancestors and, when they followed a death, the necessary supplication to the deceased to ensure that he did not remain nearby as a harmful ghost.

“The naleoana served, then, to regulate the relationship between the dead and the living. In this way chiefs, in staging naleoana, were seen to perform a vital task on behalf of their people. Hence the latter's burden of obligation to the former in terms of material goods and labour was perhaps seen as balanced or tempered with this reciprocal action for the common good.” (Facey, 1982, pp. 43-44)

""So far I have spoken of ‘small’ and ‘big’ or ‘high’ chiefs; but one ‘higher’ than these is in existence today. He is the grandson of Matokoaale to whom Milne referred many times as ‘head-chief’ [53] of Tanoropo and as the ‘highest chief on Nguna’. Matokoaale is said to have been a descendant of a supernatural female being who was captured on Efate and married to a man of Siviri village on the North coast of Efate. This quasi-woman had two sons, one of whom crossed to Nguna and was given land and a people to rule by chief Masekaau of Raitoa [see Appendix II). In due time this newcomer, whose chiefly name was Taripoaliu, became high chief over that whole dominion as well as four others. He initiated the slaughter of an unheard-of number of pigs – 1,000 - at his investiture, earning the name ‘head of a thousand’ (napau ni manu}. Thereafter at the investiture of other ‘big’ chiefs within his newly-created realm 50 rather than 100 pigs were sacrificed.

“This is said to have taken place many generations ago. Matokoaale held this. position in 1870, but the chiefly name, Taripoaliu, had already been officially passed to another man … Although the origin of the first Taripoaliu and the line of descent linking Matokoaale with him remain relatively obscure, it is clear that Matokoaale was more powerful than the other ‘high chiefs’ with whom he was allied.Milne cites an incident in which Matokoaale had the high chief, Masekaau [also known as Masikailapalapal, killed. [54] In Milne’s words this was
“’…[for] becoming rich and ambitious. He owned many pigs and he wore very broad armlets and, in his arrogant belief that no one dare interfere, he had misconducted himself with the wife of a Tanoropo man.’ (In Don 1927: 151)

“Parsonson's research further illuminates this event. He has suggested (per letter: Dec. 5, 1980) that Masekaau was ‘... a high chief in his own right, if not sometime head of one of the confederacies on the island’. Moreover, he adds this crucial bit of information: the heir to the murdered Masekaau made claim to the title of Taripoaliu in 1936 and the then incumbent (Suasavil) Taripoaliu offered to stand down in his favour. This was never effected, but it strongly indicates that the murder of Masekaau was not a jural act to punish sexual ‘misconduct’, as Milne interpreted it. It was, rather, the calculated removal of a real or potential rival to Matokoaale. Matokoaale was able to maintain his position thereafter, but Parsonson points out that he left soon after that incident to teach on Emae. This does not sustain the image of a man in a supreme position, a ‘paramount chief’. It has more the character of a flight from retribution on the part of a ‘big man’ who has overstepped his authority and fears that his own life may be in jeopardy.” (Facey, 1982, pp. 52-54)

""Other lesser spirits were many. Each chief had at least one in his dominion that dwelt in a particular cave, a hole in a rock or tree, or in the sea.

The ‘village’ as we know it today - a highly nucleated aggregation of dwellings inhabited by people of whom many are not consanguineally related to each other - had not yet come into existence in the 19th century. Today dominions and villages are in a one-to-one relationship, so that one may cite one village and thereby imply the entire area to which its members lay claim. This was not true in the past ... Within any given dominion there were once various numbers of dispersed hamlets or villages, each composed of smaller groups of houses ·inhabited by extended families.

""The head of the village is known as lakay. He is usually a man past middle age whose wealth and superior knowledge have given him the confidence of his people. He is chosen by the older men of the village, and holds his position for life unless he is removed for cause. It is possible that, at his death, his son may succeed him, but this is by no means certain.

""The lakay is supposed to be well versed in the customs of the ancestors, and all matters of dispute or questions of policy are brought to him. If the case is one of special importance he will summon the other old men, who will deliberate and decide the question at issue. They have no means of enforcing their decisions other than the force of public opinion, but since an offender is ostracised, until he has met the conditions imposed by the elders, their authority is actually very great. Should a lakay deal unjustly with the people, or attempt to alter long established customs, he would be removed from office and another be selected in his stead. No salary or fees are connected with this office, the holder receiving his reward solely through the esteem in which he is held by his people.

""In former times two or three villages would occasionally unite to form a loose union, the better to resist a powerful enemy, but with the coming of more peaceful times such beginnings of confederacies have vanished. During the Spanish regime attempts were made to organize the pagan communities and to give titles to their officers, but these efforts met with little success. Under American rule local self government, accompanied by several elective offices, has been established in many towns. The contest for office and government recognition of the officials is tending to break down the old system and to concentrate the power in the presidente or mayor.""

""Tribal groups (butubutu) in Roviana are headed by chiefs (bangara) and at the village level, elders (palabatu), who exercise control over access to land and sea resources within ancestral estates (pepeso). Conceptually these estates consist of property domains extending from the mountains of the New Georgia mainland down to the barrier islands and out to sea, ending halfway to Rendova (Aswani 1997:143). As a central place, Nusa Roviana is a grounded axis marking some of the more important territorial divisions. The island is divided into three major districts … The outer seaward coast is Vuragare and is historically associated with the near coast of Rendova and the barrier islands lying on the reef heading west. The inner lagoon side of the island is Kalikoqu, and has given its name to one of Roviana’s largest tribal areas, encompassing the lagoon and coastal mainland up to the barrier reef village of Baraulu. The northwest promontory of Nusa Roviana is named Kokorapa, and is associated with territory on the mainland opposite and towards Munda. Kokorapa is the site of the present day village, which itself is further divided into hamlets composed of descendants of different ancestors. Likewise, Vuragare and Kalikoqu are also further divided into sections corresponding to the sites of hamlets, mostly now abandoned."" (Thomas, 2003, p. 58)

Overview of leadership:

""Following Keesing (1985), Roviana leadership can be thought of in terms of three dimensions of control: ability in managing a ritual sphere of communication with ancestral spirits; demonstration of power through violence; and ability in social management and wealth accumulation, Keesing argues that in Malaita, these elements were idealised types of paths leaders might fit or follow – a successful person could become a priest, a warrior, or an entrepreneur depending on their natural disposition and persona choice … The Roviana case seems similarly to revolve around these dimensions, with established positions of hiama (priest), tie varane (warrior), palabatu (village heads or elders) and bangara. However, heredity seems to have been the guiding principle in determining  which persons were actually eligible for leadership status … So far, I have used the term ‘bangara’ as equivalent to ‘chief’ and this is how it is glossed in Pijin. But, in relation to the ‘big man/chief’ opposition of earlier anthropology, the translation does not sit well. It is clear that bangara status was not realized according to strict rules, but instead could arise through various combinations of achievement, personality, and inheritance … the title itself applied to the ceremonially installed (vabangaria) head of a butubutu, and so had some genealogical basis … Appointment was ideally based on formal selection from close descendants of ancestral bangara or nomination by a predecessor before death. However, actual public acceptance of bangara status was decided by the community’s judgement of an appointee’s performance [104] and character. (Thomas, 2003, pp. 103-104)

Role of the bangara:

""The ‘boys’ referred to here are the retinue of followers a bangara could expect to lend aid during headhunting raids and attendant practices. But this can be extended to all members of the butubutu able to help in communal enterprises such as building, or gardening … Hocart’s informants held that an ideal bangara was ‘strong – they possessed enough shell valuables to support bonito fishing, head-hunting raids and frequent large feasts; they controlled garden lands, pigs and Canarium but trees; and some held ritual knowledge of spells … For the community as a whole, such a bangara was the moral epitome of benevolence, generosity and strength – they promoted peace and prosperity (White 1991:10-2) … It was the bangara who negotiated the sacrifices, punishments and compensation payments (hinere) necessary when community members committed adultery or murder. As with opposite-sex siblings there was a supernatural bond between the behaviour of commoners and the fortune of the bangara – unpunished adultery led the sickness or death of the bangara, and murder resulted in the extinction of a family or decimation of the district by tomate ta sekena or boso lau (spirits of murder victims) … The latent violence derived, in part, from the role of bangara as sponsors of headhunting expeditions (qeto). As noted above, success in headhunting was a material proof of having [107] been blessed by ancestral mana – bangara, as descendant representatives of the ancestors, were the managers of these practices and recipients of blessings (which by extension transferred to their followers within the butubutu). Consequently, headhunting can be thought of as a form of ancestor veneration that was both dependent on bangara and enhanced their authority to rule.

""It was the sole responsibility of bangara to decide when to confuct a raid, usually on specific occasions of inauguration or transition for which enemy headswere ceremonially required. Such occasions included the inauguration of skull shrines, communal houses (paele), ritual structures (zelepade), and tomoko [war canoes]; the death of a bangara; and the release the mourning widow of a bangara from confinement (Hocart, 1931: 303).""

21188,Pohnpei,86,3,150-3,"""At the time of O'Connell's arrival, the chiefs dominated Pohnpeian society. Indeed, their status was now the single most important organizing concept around which Pohnpeian society revolved. Pohnpeians knew themselves through their relationships with with the chiefs, who linked the people with the land, with their past, and with thieri gods. Two distinct chiefly lines governed each of the four states or chiefdoms then existing on Pohnpei ... In addition to the four principal chiefdoms of Madolenihmw, U, Kiti, and Sokehs, there were smaller autonomous areas such as Awak and Palikir ruled by two lines of chiefs, but with different titles and having different traditions.

""Each wehi 'chiefdom' was composed of smaller sections of land called kousapw; these kousapw, in turn, consisted of individual farmsteads or pieces of land called peliensapw. Each kousapw possessed two governing lines of titles that mirrored those of the the larger chiefdom. Originally called meseni en keinek when the clans served as the principal units of social organization, the section leader, by O'Connell's day, had come to be known as the soumas en kousapw.

""When addressing the nahnmwarki, the people used the third person plural and spoke in a special language of respect to honor both the man and the spirits about him. A serious infraction of his will could lead to banishment or death. All land and all things produced from it belonged in principle to the nahnmwarki; this control over land provided the basis for his more worldly power. All the lesser chiefs and kousapw heads held their land in trust from the nahnmwarki; the common people, in turn, received their rights to individual farmsteads from these leaders. Thus all of the people lived and worked upon the land at the nahnmwarki's pleasure. It was he who gave and he who took away."" (Hanlon, 1988, pp 39-40)",hanlon1988[39-40]

Some promotion of the bladek did take place, however, when the political fortunes of a family rose to control a village or territory or when a family bladek was a widely admired hero. The bladek, or household spirit, was 'bumped up' to become a village or areawide god, and so the household bladek became chelid ... [171] ... The bladek were the focus of a family cult, with the leading male (rubak) as the one who gave honors to them ... But the bladek were only part of the Palauan religion. Problems could arise that could not be solved at the level of the bladek, and so more powerful spirits had to be sought out. These more powerful spirits were the chelid, and their priests were the possessed persons known as the korong ... Early descriptions show the chelid as one of two types, or perhaps one should say they perform one of two functions. First, they could be the gods (protectors) of clans, village, and groups of villages; these were the territorial gods very much involved in the politics of the clans and villages. Their importance waxed and waned with the political and military success of clans and villages. Gods 'went' beyond the confines of a single village, if that village was successful in conquering other villages ... Undoubtedly, one of the main political strengths of the chelid was that they were regularly consulted through the divination of the chelid priests: 'The territorial gods become most important in the consultations of the chieftains, and no sovereign will dare to undertake something without asking the korong for advice. Therefore, every political transaction begins with [172] a visit to the korong, if one is at hand' (Kubary 1888, 28). The korong were the inspired priests of the chelid; they functioned as diviners for the chiefs under the guise of being possessed by their patron chelid and often through the means of a self-induced trance ... In certain villages, the village itself was ruled directly by the chelid and his korong, who became the leading chief. Thus, the power of the chelid in political affairs was both directly and indirectly significant ... It takes no great leap of imagination to see that the chelid—really their korong—were a potential power threat to the political leaders. Krämer thought that the ranking of the chelid as number twenty on the list of chiefs (rubak) in some places represented attempts to check the power of the chelid and their mouthpieces."" (Dobbins, 2011, pp 170-172)

""The 'calling' of the korong, therefore, was culturally demonstrated in the bizarre behavior (in the later descriptions of korong performances, it is clear that the behavior is a real or feigned trance that is interpreted as possession by the chelid) and finally confirmed by the chiefs, perhaps in the council of the chiefs."" (Dobbin, 2011, p. 177)

""In the last quarter of the nineteenth century, however, the korong were still political powers to be reckoned with. Sometimes they supplanted the leading political chiefs, as in the case of the seven villages ruled by the korong in a sort of theocracy; sometimes they were needed to confirm and bolster the authority of the chiefs; sometimes they jockeyed for power with chiefs; and sometimes they lost in the power play and were ranked low in the chiefly system. They obtained and held power because they often monopolized the cultural supply and demand for divining and ascertaining the future; their service made some wealthy, and the payment for their service, tenget, is today the word for 'taxes' (Force and Force 1972).

""Yet even before the fall of the chelid, the korong’s status was subject to change: 'Tenure in the rank of korong is always an unstable matter' (Kubary 1888, 20). The korong remained leaders only so long as the god remained with them. Alas, Kubary did not record how the chiefs and the people recognized that the chelid had departed. Considering that the trance or trancelike state was a sign of the presence of the god, the departure of the god might have been failure to induce a trace state, or perhaps the signal was failure to regularly predict the future. 

[180] ""One cannot help but notice that, however politically powerful the korong once was, his role was very limited: He was a diviner and a medium of the chelid—but only of certain chelid. In addition to the priests, wrote Kubary, there are 'countless magicians, seers, conjurers, and the fortune tellers, who have been peacefully accepted by the priests who hold sway' (1888, 39) ...""

'Priests' (Nooy-Palm, 1979, pp. 274-293)

""First and foremost an adat -community denotes an autonomous political unit which inhabits a territory of its own and has its own adat, or system of customs. Furthermore one or more rituals are celebrated collectively by all members of a given adat-community. These rituals resemble to a considerable degree the rituals celebrated in other similar communities in what is known today as Tana Toraja, Yet, there are many local variants which, on occasion, deviate from more common patterns of observance.

“Every community has its own sacral artefacts ... The sacral artefacts are preserved in adat -houses (tongkonan), several of which exist in any adat-community ... Every tongkonan is the center of a specific ramage or subramage. The tongkonan was founded in the past by a leading ancestor of this marapuan or rapu and has since remained its social and religious center.

“As a ramage expands it eventually undergoes segmentation. The separating subramage then builds itself a new tongkonan which, being of later origin, is of lower status. It remains, however, the tongkonan of the leading ramage (or ramages) which lends distinction to the territory as a whole. The history of the leading (sub)ramage is closely intertwined with the history of the adat-community as such. A number of important subramages can reside in an adat-community in addition to the leading one itself. More often than not these are blood relatives of the leading subramage. Furthermore, within the territorial bounds of the community families from the lower classes will also make their homes here.

“[60] Not only eminent ramages, but also other families as well, often have a title. The leading family has the most significant title. Titleholders each have a specific area of competence and a concomitant role to perform in ritual. Functionaries also come together on the occasion of meetings, for councils concerning war and peace. One of the titleholders (a man belonging to the most important family) is primus inter pares . His voice is usually decisive in settling legal disputes.

“The Toraja language has no word for denoting the concept of adat-community in general: instead they differentiate a certain rank list of communities according to size and rank. In order of ascending magnitude, adat -communities are considered to belong to one of the following four categories:

“bua’ — or penanian (the bua’ -areas, see IV.1.2); patang penanian (see IV.1.4); lembang (see IV.1.4); tallulembangna (see IV.1.7).

“The village as a unit will be discussed in a separate section of the text (IV.2). Although it encompasses a territory in the traditional sense of the word, it differs in some ways from the bua’-, patang penanian- or lembang -communities. The village, moreover, often coincides with a bua’-community (it can also include two bua’-groups; on the other hand several villages together may constitute a single bua’ -community) ... A single bua’ -community includes a territorial area within which the inhabitants celebrate the bua’ padang -ritual together  ...[61] ... This ritual is a kind of agricultural New Year celebration with the aim of imploring the higher powers to smile on man, beast and the produce of the fields (in this instance, rice). The word penanian originally had a different meaning, for it is derived from nani (‘to sing’); it signified the performance of choral song during the above-mentioned bua’ -ritual. The term penanian is synonymous with bua’ -circle; it merely depends on what area or village a person lives in which of the two terms he will happen to use.

""Here, since the bua’ -feast will be described at length elsewhere (see Vol. II), I will limit my remarks about the celebration. It should be indicated, however, that the small bua’ -ritual ( bua’ padang ) must not be confused with the great bua’ -feast, the bua’ - or la’pa’ kasalle .

“We noted that a bua’ -unit can encompass half of a village, a whole one or several villages together. As opposed to the lembang, a bua’ seldom has a proper name, although people sometimes refer to it by the name of the relevant village (especially where bua’ and village coincide).
	
“Although I described the bua’-ritual above as a kind of agricultural New Year celebration, this does not mean that the bua’ padang was ever held annually ... Rather, celebration was performed on a rotation basis: village A, constituting a bua’-circle, observed the bua’ padang one year, village B (another bua’-circle) followed suit the next, village C (with bua’-circle C thus) enacted the ritual the third year, etc. ... A patang penanian is a federation composed of four penanian or bua’ -units (patang = four) which, apparently, celebrate the bua’ padang -feast in keeping with a cyclical arrangement like that described immediately above. Members of such a federation make up a larger administrative whole, larger than their own bua’ -group. The whole is also more than the sum of its parts, for there is an adat -chief for the patang penanian as an entity ... [62] ... The members of a patang penanian observe an important ritual together, such as, for example, a merok -feast or a great bua’-feast, the bua’- or la’pa’kasalle ... A patang penanian can itself be in turn part of a larger federal union, or even of a state. Thus La’bo’, a patang penanian consisting of four villages (= four penanian ), Mengke’pe, Marante, Tandung and Karatuan, is itself a member of the federation of Kesu’.

“There are also penanian -federations in the princedoms of Sangalla’ and Ma’kale. In the former the bond has the form of a patang penanian; in the latter, two forms of union are found, the karua penanian (‘the eight penanian’ ) and sangpulo dua penanian (‘the twenty-two penanian’ ). The eight members of the karua penanian are all situated in or near the village of Lemo; the twenty-two members of the other league are all clustered in the vicinity of Awa. It is not apparent to me how these smaller federations function in the context of larger socio-political units ...“Lembang means proa or ship. The term is also used to denote a territory of varying compass … In these pages I will only use the word to denote an adat -community governed by a single set of laws, a group of people inhabiting a certain territory of larger dimensions than a bua’ or [Page 63] penanian . Such usage is well-founded on Toraja tradition which refers to the three puang -states of Tana Toraja as the Tallulembangna (‘the three lembang ’).

“During Dutch rule, such a traditional territory was usually made into an administrative district. As a rule such a lembang can be described as a federation of different bua’ -circles or of  various tondok (‘villages’). Three to nine bua’ usually constitute a lembang but the number can rise. Every lembang has a leader, an indo’ lembang or ma’dika lembang . Some lembang are princedoms under a puang.” (Nooy-Palm, 1979, pp. 59-63)

""The Sa'dan-Toraja have various categories of priests and priestesses, each with a specific competence in the enactment of rituals ... By virtue of their supernatural descent adat-chiefs - the puang and the to parengnge' - naturally have a significant role in the celebration of any important feast. Part of their functions the chiefs can delegate to the priests, especially the recitation of litanies. Other roles are not transferable. It is the leading member of society who, officially at least, takes the initiative to hold a community feast; execution of the ritual, recitation of the pertinent litanies and the presentation of offerings are, to a great extent, the prerogatives of a priest who has his own, inalienable functions."" (Nooy-Palm, 1979, p 274) 

“All of the priests discussed thus far have been men. The most important religious functionaries among the Sa’dan-Toraja, however, are a woman, the burake tattiku’ and an hermaphrodite, a man dressed as a woman, the burake tambolang . They fill the leading roles during the la’pa’ kasalle -feast which J. Kruyt has described as the bua’ ritual (1921: 45-78 and 161-187).” (Nooy-Palm, 1979, p. 282)","nooy-palm1979[58-92, 294-293]"

""In pre-Christian times each village had a sorcerer who was authorized to communicate with the spirits. The sorcerer's house was said to be surrounded by spirits, the ala palits, who were dangerous to everyone in the village and to women and children especially. The sorcerer could summon the spirits whenever he liked. Inside his house would be found a wooden bowl, into which he put food for the spirits every day. Thus the spirits were thought to congregate more or less in the vicinity of this wooden bowl. The living not only feared the spirits but also this bowl and the food that was in it. The sorcerer was also held to have the power to inflict illness on the living, irrespective of which tali [clan] they belonged to. Once the illness had been inflicted however, the sorcerer could not cure it, that is, he could not recover the soul stuff from the spirits, and another sorcerer would have to be sent for (Parkinson 1911: 402)."" (Gustafsson, 1992, p. 31)

""According to Parkinson it was only one man, the sorcerer, who could influence the dangerous powers in the village, in the form of kot and the ala palits, and he also had the power to inflict illness on the living. Illness was the sanction visited upon individual members of the tali [kin group] who failed to fulfil obligations towards their relatives. Although members of other talis were considered alien relationships existed with individual men belonging to other talis, through marriage. Once a relationship was established wealth would be regularly exchanged between the two domestic communities. One man, as we shall see later, could not collect wealth on his own to distribute to his affinal kin, but he was dependent on other members of his family for contributions. The good spirits, according to Parkinson, did not inflict illness and, thereby, were not credited with power to penalize members of the tali who might fail to, for example, contribute in exchanges with affinal kin. The sorcerer alone had this power. It is apparent then that the sorcerer, through his ability to inflict illness, saw that individual members of different talis fulfilled their obligations towards their kin.

""When Fortune visited Manus he did not observe any sorcerers in the villages. When, and why, the sorcerers had stopped performing their art, is not known to us; one may suspect, however, that both the missionaries and the colonial administration had been opposed to the kind of rituals they performed. When the sorcerers were no longer given the opportunity to perform their rituals, then their power over the spirits also came to an end. The wooden bowl, which was where the spirits had congregated, thereby, seems to have disappeared from the sorcerer's house. Fortune could not find any tjinals and instead all skulls were resting in wooden bowls, that were placed in that part of the family house which symbolized the tjinal. The wooden bowls that the skulls now rested in, we shall argue, were the same bowls as those which had earlier [Page 33] been placed in the sorcerer's house. The dangerous spirits, thus, did not disappear, and the bowl, in which the spirits resided, was placed under the skull. When the sorcerers no longer could perform their rituals in public, then the power shared by kot and the ala palits to inflict illness, had been transformed and representionally fused into the skull and the tjinal.

Surrounding the nucleus were village households related to that core (see the ta-djaLan above), along with those non-related households residing on core land. This ritual unit, therefore, has traditionally coincided with the political unit of the chiefdom. In a few villages in western Paiwan territory, however, a chief from a household established through budding from an original chief's household occupied part of the original village land, but organized a separate ritual group with villagers who lived on, and who cultivated land given to the new chief. These would be communal rituals on a smaller scale, and this new group would join the original chief's ritual group for large-scale rituals (discussed in detail in the last part of this chapter) ... Communal rituals are led by chiefs as a couple, along with two priests, male and female, called parakalay. In a few villages, such as Su-Paiwan and Kapiyan, there were several appointed priests, male and female (see Kojima et al 1922: 54-55). The common way to appoint a priest was by selection of a proper person from among all villagers by the chief and the village elders, and then to ask the will of their ancestors' spirits through divination, whether this was a correct selec­tion. Only a few villages, such as Su-Paiwan and some southern villages, reported that such priests were appointed from amongst chiefly families (ibid: 55-57). Several shamannesses, all female, were reported for each village. They were called maLada in the western areas and puLigaw in eastern villages. Male priests were assigned to hunting rituals, and female priests were assigned to agricultural rituals in communal rituals. Shamannesses sometimes  assisted priests in communal rituals, but were mainly engaged in private rituals and in various kinds of divination.

19877,tetum,84,3,149-3,"‘Administrative Structure’ (Hicks, 2004, pp. 14-16)

At the time of Hicks' fieldwork the Tetum lived in 'princedoms' (suku or fukun) divided into 'villages' (povoações) which were in turn divided into hamlets (knua). The princedoms had previously been grouped into 'kingdoms' (rai), but these had been abolished several decades earlier, and the princedoms were now directly subordinate to the Portuguese administration. 'Suku' could also refer to a 'collection of clans that shared the same traditions'. The extent to which a suku in the sense of a princedom and a suku in the sense of a collection of clans coincided is not quite clear:

“The Province of Timor is divided into ten concelhos or ‘districts,’ each of which is governed by an administrator who reports to the governor at Dili, the provincial capital. These districts had replaced the former circunscições. Each district consists of several postos or ‘subdistricts,’ each administered by a chefe de posto or subdistrict commissioner. One of these subdistricts (the posto sede or ‘subdistrict seat’) serves as the seat of administration for the entire district, and this is where the administrator resides. Within it he also functions as subdistrict commissioner. Each subdistrict consists of a constel [15] lation of units called sukus, each administered by a chefe de suku or liurai who, as the chief of the suku, reports to the subdistrict commissioner. Each suku consists of a varying number of povoações or villages … each governed by a chefe de povoaçao or village headman. In the region where I carried out my fieldwork most villages consist of a varying number of dispersed settlements, consisting of anything up to a dozen or so houses (uma), known as knuas … or hamlets, which are set apart from their neighbours by savanna and woodland. The liurais, and to a much lesser degree the headmen, represent the Portuguese administration to the local Timorese populace, and although the villagers elect them, their appointment must be ratified by the administration before they can assume office.

“The term suku is a Malay word that is used throughout the archipelago, but with different, albeit overlapping, meanings depending upon locality. In Timor, as we have seen, it is a territorial unit within the Portuguese administrative system of governance, but the term also refers to a collection of clans that share the same traditions. The term is used throughout Timor, but in some regions the local population may employ alternative designations derived from their particular languages. In Caraubalo, one of the seven sukus making up the subdistrict seat of Viqueque district, this local alternative is fukun ... There is no self-evident English translation of either fukun or suku, but in view of the fact that the indigenous unit denoted by these terms is a sub-unit of the traditional kingdom, the term 'princedom' would seem as apt as any, and I shall adopt it here … With the dismantling of the kingdoms the sukuas that composed them were left intact, and in many cases it was the traditional liurai families who came to occupy the new office of chefe de suku that the administration created to run the suku. Today, the title liurai is used all over Portuguese Timor, but now it does not denote the head of a kingdom, that is, a confederation of sukus, but the more limited position occupied by the chief of a suku. Even so, the superior education of liurai families and the traditional prestige in which they are held typically means that a scion of liurai lineage usually occupies the influential position of chefe de suku, and while their influential range is limited to the suku rather than the kingdom (rai), liurais – or rather, liurai families – continue to exercise political influence among the local population … In Viqueque kingdom, before the office of chefe de suku had ever come into existence, Caraubalo suku was governed by a pair of indigenous figures known as the makair fukun (Mane Hat village) and the dato ua’in (Mamulak village). They were [16] said to govern the suku jointly ‘as husband and wife govern the household, loving their dependants and respecting each other.’ Both were also headmen of their respective villages, and their offices have endured, with some erosion of their traditional authority, which has been arrogated to some degree by the Portuguese-backed office of chefe de suku.” (Hicks, 2004, pp. 14-16)

‘The World of Spirits’ (Hicks, 2004, pp. 25-46)

Hicks mentions two three types of religious specialist: 'priests', 'rainmakers', and 'shamans'. Priests are explicitly described as 'office holders' who served the 'suku community'. Rainmakers appear to have played a similar role. Hicks denies that shamans were office-holders:

""The priest is an office-holder who usually inherits his posi- [43] tion from a male in the paternal line and carries our public sacrifices on behalf of the suku community as a whole ... The priest also serves as guardian of any ritual house (uma lulik) that the suku or descent group may own ... A priest traditionally exercised an important political duty during the wars that occurred between kingdoms before the Portuguese pacification. At the ritual house owned by the suku he would administer a blessing to the warriors prior to their departure on a raid … Another figure involved in war rituals was the rainmaker. One of the rainmaker’s functions was to accompany the warriors to the vicinity of the enemy where he would then extract lime from his sacred lime container, and with the white powder in the palm of his left hand, he would blow it in the general direction where the enemy troops were thought to lurk, thereby rendering his own warriors invisible … The Timorese shaman is the local version of a magico-religious functionary known throughout much of the eastern archipelago as the dukun, whose position, unlike that of priest, is not inherited nor is it an office in the sense that it has an existence independent of its incumbent ... [44] ... Like the witch, the shaman transcends both the profane world and the sacred domain, but in contrast to the rainmaker and priest, the shaman's power does not derive from succeeding in patrilineal succession from his or her father, but rather through allegedly commanding this talent from prediction and interpretation ... and having the capacity to convince clients he or she has either cured them or appreciably ameliorated their ills.""

The highest rank in this hierarchy belongs to the Deo Rai, ‘Lord of the Earth;’ second in rank is the Apu Lodo, ‘Descendant of the Sun.’ Thereafter, in the separate hierarchies, there is a variable structure of religious offices and attendant functionaries. Succession to all of these offices is strictly determined within specific clans; however, the persons selected for the office do not perform rituals for their own clans, but on behalf of the entire state ... For all necessary rituals the priests have the right to demand appropriate sacrificial animals from the entire populace.” (Fox, 1977, p 85)

17640,ajie,84,3,149-3,"Ajie-speakers lived in localised ‘clans’ grouped into looser ‘tribes’. Both were led by chiefs, who were also mediators with ancestral spirits, which played the dominant role in the indigenous religion: 

“Social life in traditional Caledonia rested on a system of matrilineal, patrilocal clans imprecisely designated as ‘tribe’ or ‘village.’ Within a single linguistic area, regular patterns of exchange linked clan to clan … Functioning in complementarity with the totemic life force of the maternal lineage was the paternal political structure. This ‘power’ was associated primarily with the ancestors, the grande case, and the chief. The chief was a nonautocratic ‘older brother,’ who mediated between the world of the living and the parallel world of the dead. His effective power was limited by the council of elders, who controlled the succession ... and by the clan’s uterine relations. In general, the small-scale political structure of the clan in New Caledonia was egalitarian and minimally hierarchical ... Although a number of clans in a given area could be united by a larger and looser ‘tribal’ organization presided over by a grand chef, the principal ties were still ones of dialect and kinship. These groups, varying considerably in size and coherence, lived in semipermanent hostility, a state of ‘war’ tempered by custom and alliance ... There existed, nonetheless, a marked homogeneity of custom throughout the island. The life of every group was guarded by its totems and ancestors immanent in the landscape. And everywhere, the culminating moment of social life was the celebration of the pilou ceremony ... Through it a clan expressed its vitality with displays of verbal eloquence, dances, and ostentatious distribution of food and gifts. The event varied in size from the regional grand pilou organized by a grand chef to more intimate, familiar rituals. 

[42] “Pilous and traditional marriage practices would present a thorny problem to Leenhardt and the natas [Melanesian missionaries]. Could New Caledonian Protestantism preach social regeneration and at the same time oppose the most important ‘pagan’ manifestations of social health? Pilous, especially their religious aspects – dances to the dead and other ‘savage excesses’ – seemed the epitome of a tradition that could not be reconciled with Christianity.” (Cllifford, 1982, pp. 41-42)

More on the religious role of the chief:

""Although the structure of society is made up of sociomythic domains and the structure of the habitat of spatiomythic domains, their ensemble remains poorly defined unless a certain personage detaches himself from it and dominates its practical organization … The whole society revolves around this personage … He has no governmental function nor does he command. His presence makes tangible to all, the mythic reality of the totems and ancestors. He is ‘their presence’ and as such he presides over all the clan’s behaviour. The big house is his as well as the altar. He delegates his younger brother to tend the altar. A group of chiefs does not stand in opposition to a group of priests. Every man can relate them to his ancestors; there is a virtually universal priesthood that reigns in this society. The chief retains his prerogatives at the clan’s altar and may officiate if he so wishes. He uses no magic but calls magicians to him … Magician and priest must both obey the chief.""

The 'primary religious practitioners' were called the mitu duan and leb:

""The  indigenous  religion  of  the  Keiese  involved  the  belief  in  a  dualistic  supreme  deity,  the  Sun-Moon God … as well as ancestral spirits (nit), non-anthropomorphic local spirits (mitu) and evil spirits (foar).

These two practitioners are explicitly described as 'village functionaries':

""In addition to the orang kaya and kepala soa, van Wouden (1968:36-37) identified four additional village functionaries: (1) tuan tan, (2) mitu duan, (3) leb, and (4) dir-u ham-wang. The tuan tan, or ‘lord of the land’, is held by a ren-ren individual who is a descendant of the [102] founding clan of a village. According to van Wouden (1968:36-37), this position was purely titular in some location, but in others had remained important. If anyone wished to clear land for new planting on village land, they had to inform the tuan tan. The tuan tan also performed divination rituals concerning the success of crops, as well as aides in the settlement of disputes over land (van Wouden 1968:36-7). The third and fourth village functionaries were the mitu duan (the attendant of the local village spirit) and the leb (a religious official who administered oaths and renders supernaturally-inspired judgments). A fifth position was that of the dir-u ham-wang, which was the honorary post of ‘pilot’ (dir-u) in the village ceremonial canoe (belang) as well as the village carver of communally hunted large game (ham-wang) (van Wouden 1968:36-7).

A larger unit called the lor ('domain' also existed), headed by a figure called the rat. There is no indication that the rat held religious authority. His function was to administer the law, which appears to have been largely secular:

“Throughout the Kei archipelago, there are 19 … domains or ‘little kingdoms’, seven on the island of Kei Besar and twelve spread throughout the islands of Kei Kecil … Today, these domains are often referred to as ratschap, a term combining the Kei word rat [56] (king or chief) with the Dutch suffix ‘–schaap’ meaning “-ship” (Thorburn 2008:126). Ratschap was first used by the Dutch to refer the domains of the Kei Islands, which are sometimes referred to as lor in the Kei language (see Rahail 1993, 1996) … [57] … Each ratschap is headed by a rat. The ratschap of the Kei Islands are further organized into two large confederations or ‘political moieties’ (Valeri 1989) known as ur siu (the nine [58] moiety) and lor lim (the five moiety) (van Wouden 1966). 18 The Keiese claim that these nonterritorial confederations were mobilized in times of war and distress. Nine ratschap belong to the ur siu moiety, nine others belong to the lor lim moiety, while 2 ratschap are politically neutral (or lor labay). With the exception of these neutral ratschap, each domain consists of a number of villages, ranging from 3 villages (Songli centered in Rumat on Kei Kecil) to 46 villages (Maur Ohoivuut on Kei Besar).” (Hooe, 2012, pp. 55-58)

“Kei adat law is known as Larvul Ngabal (Larvul means ‘red blood’ and Ngabal means ‘spear from Bali’) (see Howes 1987; Rahail 1993). Arguably one of the most elaborate and formal adat law codes in Maluku (Thorburn 2008.115), Larvul Ngabal is comprised of seven edicts (see Figure 36) that are further divided into three categories of law: (1) Hukum Nevnev (edicts 1-4), (2) Hukum Hanilit (edicts 5-6) and (3) Hawear Balwarin (edict 7) (Rahail 1993; Adhuri 2006; Thorburn 2008). These three categories of law are sometimes translated as ‘criminal law’ (Hukum Nevnev), ‘family law’ (Hukum Hanilit), and ‘property law’ (Hawear Balwarin) (Thorburn 2008:119) … Larvul Ngabal provides a basic framework for Kei socio-political order (Thorburn 2008:118).

""The Sa'dan-Toraja have various categories of priests and priestesses, each with a specific competence in the enactment of rituals ... By virtue of their supernatural descent adat-chiefs - the puang and the to parengnge' - naturally have a significant role in the celebration of any important feast. Part of their functions the chiefs can delegate to the priests, especially the recitation of litanies. Other roles are not transferable. It is the leading member of society who, officially at least, takes the initiative to hold a community feast; execution of the ritual, recitation of the pertinent litanies and the presentation of offerings are, to a great extent, the prerogatives of a priest who has his own, inalienable functions.""

“All of the priests discussed thus far have been men.

""Palauans made a clear distinction between the bladek and the chelid—the ancestor spirits and the gods, respectively. Some promotion of the bladek did take place, however, when the political fortunes of a family rose to control a village or territory or when a family bladek was a widely admired hero. The bladek, or household spirit, was 'bumped up' to become a village or areawide god, and so the household bladek became chelid ... [171] ... The bladek were the focus of a family cult, with the leading male (rubak) as the one who gave honors to them ... But the bladek were only part of the Palauan religion. Problems could arise that could not be solved at the level of the bladek, and so more powerful spirits had to be sought out. These more powerful spirits were the chelid, and their priests were the possessed persons known as the korong ... Early descriptions show the chelid as one of two types, or perhaps one should say they perform one of two functions. First, they could be the gods (protectors) of clans, village, and groups of villages; these were the territorial gods very much involved in the politics of the clans and villages. Their importance waxed and waned with the political and military success of clans and villages. Gods 'went' beyond the confines of a single village, if that village was successful in conquering other villages ... Undoubtedly, one of the main political strengths of the chelid was that they were regularly consulted through the divination of the chelid priests: 'The territorial gods become most important in the consultations of the chieftains, and no sovereign will dare to undertake something without asking the korong for advice. Therefore, every political transaction begins with [172] a visit to the korong, if one is at hand' (Kubary 1888, 28). The korong were the inspired priests of the chelid; they functioned as diviners for the chiefs under the guise of being possessed by their patron chelid and often through the means of a self-induced trance ... In certain villages, the village itself was ruled directly by the chelid and his korong, who became the leading chief. Thus, the power of the chelid in political affairs was both directly and indirectly significant ... It takes no great leap of imagination to see that the chelid—really their korong—were a potential power threat to the political leaders. Krämer thought that the ranking of the chelid as number twenty on the list of chiefs (rubak) in some places represented attempts to check the power of the chelid and their mouthpieces."" (Dobbins, 2011, pp 170-172)

""The 'calling' of the korong, therefore, was culturally demonstrated in the bizarre behavior (in the later descriptions of korong performances, it is clear that the behavior is a real or feigned trance that is interpreted as possession by the chelid) and finally confirmed by the chiefs, perhaps in the council of the chiefs."" (Dobbin, 2011, p. 177)

""In the last quarter of the nineteenth century, however, the korong were still political powers to be reckoned with. Sometimes they supplanted the leading political chiefs, as in the case of the seven villages ruled by the korong in a sort of theocracy; sometimes they were needed to confirm and bolster the authority of the chiefs; sometimes they jockeyed for power with chiefs; and sometimes they lost in the power play and were ranked low in the chiefly system. They obtained and held power because they often monopolized the cultural supply and demand for divining and ascertaining the future; their service made some wealthy, and the payment for their service, tenget, is today the word for 'taxes' (Force and Force 1972).

""Yet even before the fall of the chelid, the korong’s status was subject to change: 'Tenure in the rank of korong is always an unstable matter' (Kubary 1888, 20). The korong remained leaders only so long as the god remained with them. Alas, Kubary did not record how the chiefs and the people recognized that the chelid had departed. Considering that the trance or trancelike state was a sign of the presence of the god, the departure of the god might have been failure to induce a trace state, or perhaps the signal was failure to regularly predict the future. 

[180] ""One cannot help but notice that, however politically powerful the korong once was, his role was very limited: He was a diviner and a medium of the chelid—but only of certain chelid. In addition to the priests, wrote Kubary, there are 'countless magicians, seers, conjurers, and the fortune tellers, who have been peacefully accepted by the priests who hold sway' (1888, 39) ...""

The ‘tribe’ comprises a single ritual group, wherein branch villages observe the same rituals and taboos as the head village, and wherein the ‘tribal’ chieftain is both secular and religious leader. The senior village men's house serves a combined administrative, military, and ritual center for the entire complex. Chieftainship is in principle hereditary within chiefly patrilineages, and heads of satellite settlements are likely to be paternal relatives of the 'tribal' chief. These chiefly lines do not, however, constitute a privileged aristocracy as among the Paiwan-Rukai farther south. [Mabuchi 1952, 1960, 1966). The above account is given added historical depth by Kojima, who describes what appear to have been river drainage districts or domains, each controlled by a hereditary priest-chief (peonshi), who might at the same time function as war leader (ijomu) ... Peonshi were entitled to wear distinctive head gear, but they received no tribute and worked their own fields (Kojima 1915-22:4, 238-258)."" (Lebar, 1975, p. 141)",lebar1975[141]

21256,tetum,86,3,150-3,"‘Administrative Structure’ (Hicks, 2004, pp. 14-16)

“The Province of Timor is divided into ten concelhos or ‘districts,’ each of which is governed by an administrator who reports to the governor at Dili, the provincial capital. These districts had replaced the former circunscições. Each district consists of several postos or ‘subdistricts,’ each administered by a chefe de posto or subdistrict commissioner. One of these subdistricts (the posto sede or ‘subdistrict seat’) serves as the seat of administration for the entire district, and this is where the administrator resides. Within it he also functions as subdistrict commissioner. Each subdistrict consists of a constel [15] lation of units called sukus, each administered by a chefe de suku or liurai who, as the chief of the suku, reports to the subdistrict commissioner. Each suku consists of a varying number of povoações or villages … each governed by a chefe de povoaçao or village headman. In the region where I carried out my fieldwork most villages consist of a varying number of dispersed settlements, consisting of anything up to a dozen or so houses (uma), known as knuas … or hamlets, which are set apart from their neighbours by savanna and woodland. The liurais, and to a much lesser degree the headmen, represent the Portuguese administration to the local Timorese populace, and although the villagers elect them, their appointment must be ratified by the administration before they can assume office.

“The term suku is a Malay word that is used throughout the archipelago, but with different, albeit overlapping, meanings depending upon locality. In Timor, as we have seen, it is a territorial unit within the Portuguese administrative system of governance, but the term also refers to a collection of clans that share the same traditions. The term is used throughout Timor, but in some regions the local population may employ alternative designations derived from their particular languages. In Caraubalo, one of the seven sukus making up the subdistrict seat of Viqueque district, this local alternative is fukun ... There is no self-evident English translation of either fukun or suku, but in view of the fact that the indigenous unit denoted by these terms is a sub-unit of the traditional kingdom, the term 'princedom' would seem as apt as any, and I shall adopt it here … With the dismantling of the kingdoms the sukuas that composed them were left intact, and in many cases it was the traditional liurai families who came to occupy the new office of chefe de suku that the administration created to run the suku. Today, the title liurai is used all over Portuguese Timor, but now it does not denote the head of a kingdom, that is, a confederation of sukus, but the more limited position occupied by the chief of a suku. Even so, the superior education of liurai families and the traditional prestige in which they are held typically means that a scion of liurai lineage usually occupies the influential position of chefe de suku, and while their influential range is limited to the suku rather than the kingdom (rai), liurais – or rather, liurai families – continue to exercise political influence among the local population … In Viqueque kingdom, before the office of chefe de suku had ever come into existence, Caraubalo suku was governed by a pair of indigenous figures known as the makair fukun (Mane Hat village) and the dato ua’in (Mamulak village). They were [16] said to govern the suku jointly ‘as husband and wife govern the household, loving their dependants and respecting each other.’ Both were also headmen of their respective villages, and their offices have endured, with some erosion of their traditional authority, which has been arrogated to some degree by the Portuguese-backed office of chefe de suku.” (Hicks, 2004, pp. 14-16)",hicks2004[14-16]

‘The setting: The context of structural change’ (Jaspan, 1964, pp. 1-88)

Marsden describes the Rejang as living in villages ('doosoon'), each headed by a 'dupatty'. Within the same river valley or 'district', certain 'dupatty' bearing the title 'proateen' met in council in a 'legislative or judicial' capacity. The proateen in a river valley (or in members of the same tribe living in the same river valley) acknowledged a head called a 'pambarab'. The authority of all of these leaders was very limited. The 'Pangeran' at 'Soongey-lamo' claimed nominal authority over all Rejang, and enjoyed some real authority over those in his immediate vicinity. The Rejang as a whole were also divided into 'tribes', of which there were four principal tribes and several 'inferior' ones. The four principal tribes were united in a 'league offensive and defensive':

“The inhabitants of the Rejang country live in villages or doosoons, each under the government of a magistrate styled Dupatty. His dependants are termed Ana-booa, and in number seldom exceed one hundred. A certain proportion of the duppatties belonging to each river, the villages being always situated by the water side, are chosen to meet in a legislative or judicial capacity, at the qualloe or river’s mouth, and these are distinguished by the name of Proatteen. The Pangeran or prince of the country, presides over the whole. I would point out in what consists the fealty of a dupatty to a pangeran, and of his ana-booa to him, but so very little is to be observed in either case, that it is not an easy matter to describe it. Almost without arts, and with little industry, the state of property is nearly equal among all the inhabitants, and the chiefs scarcely differ but in title, from the bulk of the people. Their authority is no more than nominal, being without that coercive power, necessary to make themselves feared and implicitly obeyed.” (Marsden, 1784, p. 173)

""Those [175] doosoons which are situated nearest to the residence of the pangeran, at Soongey-lamo, acknowledge somewhat more of subordination than the distant ones, which, even in case of war, esteem themselves at liberty to assist or not, as they think proper, without being liable to consequences. In answer to a question on this point, ‘we are his subjects not his slaves,’ replied one of the proatteens. But from the pangeran you hear a tale widely different. He has been known to say, in a political conversation: ‘such and such doosoons, there will be no trouble with: they are my power and shot;’ explaining himself by adding, that he could dispose of the inhabitants, as his ancestors had done, to purchase ammunition in time of war."" (Marsden, 1784, pp. 174-175)

“The Rejangs are distinguished into tribes, the descendants of a different pooyang or ancestor. Of these there are four principal tribes ... said to derive their origin from four brothers, and to have been united from time immemorial in a league offensive and defensive: the permanency however of this bond, may be conjectured [177] to have been owing to the expediency resulting from their situation, rather than their consanguinity, or any formal compact. There are also several inferior tribes.

“Each river or district (for it is by the rivers the parts of the country influence of are distinguished) and indeed each doosoon, is independent of, though not unconnected with, its neighbours; acting in concert, only by specific consent. On every river there is at least one Pambarab or superior proatteen, who differs from the rest, in the right of presiding at those suits and festivals, in which two or more doosoons have a common concern, with a larger allotment of fines and provision. If more tribes than one are settled on the same river, each has usually its pambarab, who is chosen by the respective proatteens: these are chosen in like manner by the dupatties, but with the concurrence of the elders of the doosoon. If the choice displeases any of the inhabitants, they agree among themselves what chief they will follow, and remove to his doosoon. There is no restraint or compulsion in the case. Sometimes a few families separate themselves, and elect a chief, but without contesting the title of him whom they leave. The chiefs do not however assume the title of dupatty, without being confirmed by the pangeran, or by the Company's Resident, who in truth exercises many of the functions of sovereignty."" (Marsden, 1784, pp. 176-177)

As Jaspan (1964, p. 24) notes, Marsden translated Rejang terms into Malay. This makes it somewhat difficult to compare Marsden's description Rejang sociopolitical organization with Jaspan's. However, the two descriptions seem reasonably consistent.

The Rejang were divided into four 'patriclans' (Marsden's 'principal tribes') and a number of 'subclans' (presumably Marsden's 'inferior tribes'). The 'league offensive and defensive' that united the four patriclans was called the Djang Tiang Pat (Rejang Four Pillars'):

""Prior to the conquest of Lebong in 1859-60 by a Dutch military expedition sent for that purpose from Padang, (van Rees 1860) there was a confederation of four patriclans known originally as the Redjang Four Brothers (Djang Pat Petulai) and subsequently as the Redjang Four Pillars (Djang Tiang Pat). Marsden (1811:209) described the Redjang as 'descendants of ... four brothers ... united from time immemorial in a league offensive and defensive'. The Four Brothers are said to have been Buddhist monks or bhikkus (bikau) descended from 'the king of Majapahit' in Java. The four bikau were Bedjenggo, Bembo, Bermano and Sepanjang Djiwo (see Pedigree 1). Each of these bikau is regarded as the apical ancestor of one of the four 'pillars' or clans: Slupua, Djikalang, Bemanai and Tubeui."" (Jaspan, 1964, p. 24)

“Outside the epicentre or heartland there was a larger area settled by Redjang emigrants and cognate peoples, mainly the Lembak and Ampat Lawang, to whom a Redjang origin was ascribed by the people of Lebong. This outer territory is described as 'the land of the scattered fragments, the end of the smoke trail' (tanëa kepetjua' sumbing, mar udjung aseup) … [28] … The archaic metaphors of the kétjé symbolise both the common origin of all Redjang subclans and the derivative character of the peripheral regions from the land of the original four pillar clans.” (Jaspan, 1964, pp. 27-28)

The leader of each patriclan was called an adjai (possibly this corresponds to Marsden's 'pambarab'), and had a 'capital village'):

“The Tubeui clan was at a subsequent period divided into two moieties known as Sukau VIII and Sukau IX. Each clan had a leader called an adjai who was, except in the Tubeui clan, a descendant in the male line from the founding bikau. The Tubeui bikau, Sepanjang Djiwo, is said to have returned to Majapahit after quarreling with the other three bikau. The chieftainship of Tubeui then passed to Radjo Mawang, a descendant of Bundo Kandung, the Empress of the Radjo Alam realm of Minangkabau ... [26] ... After the conversion of the Redjang to Islam the adjai was called a pesirëa (In. pasirah) on the analogy of parish (marga) chiefs elsewhere in South Sumatra.... The cradle of the Redjang Four Brothers polity was Lebong and in the adjacent (present day) marga of Slupua Djang in the Upper Musi Valley, Each clan was territorially localised: Tubeui in North Lebong, Bemanai in central Lebong around Lake Tes, Djikalang in South Lebong and Slupua in the adjacent part of the Upper Musi Valley, in country called Butau Libëa after its chief village. Each clan had a capital village from which successive adjai and later pesirëa dispensed justice.” (Jaspan, 1964, pp. 25-26)

The Four Pillars confederation functioned as follows:

“The constitution of the confederation is unwritten but recounted in a number of kétjé. By comparing and analysing the archaic metaphors of these kétjé it becomes evident that the Four Pillars were equally represented at a Long Council House (Baleui Panjang) where the adjai, clan shamans (duku'en mergo), village headmen (ginde) and patrilineage elders (tuai-tuai djueui or sukau) assembled as occasion demanded to resolve difficult or long-standing conflicts and to conciliate the opposing parties. The rule of procedure at the Long Council was joint deliberation (baseun) and the attainment of unanimous consensus (daseun). The term daseun (and its synonym dekemoi) also implies action taken as a result of joint public deliberation and decision, and is used by Redjang with a modern education to translate the term democracy."" (Jaspan, 1964, p. 31)

The 'Pangeran' of 'Soongey-lamo' that Marsden describes can clearly be identified with the 'Radjo' at 'Sungei Lemeuw' described by Jaspan. This ruler indeed claimed hegemony over all Rejang, but this claim was only accepted by the coastal Rejang. Some of the highland Rejang accepted the nominal overlordship of another ruler:

“In order to establish a more effective system of conciliation and adjudication of disputes, the Four Pillars are said to have sent a courier to the Radjo Alam ruler of the Minangkabau kingdom at Pagar Rujung, with a request that she send a deputy who could be their supreme judge and ensure peace among the four clans. The Redjang of Lais, and especially the Semitoa non-pillar clan at Sungei Lemeuw a few kilometres to the north of Bencoolen, claim that the deputy sent from Pagar Rujung was Sri Maharadja Sakti who landed at Sungei Lemeuw and established a court at Balai Buntar nearby. According to his descendants, who still bear the title of radjo, Sri Maharadja Sakti's pre-eminence was recognised by the Four Pillars, and henceforth the Redjang polity was referred to as 'Four Redjang Pillars, Five with the Radja' (Djang Tiang Pat, lemo ngen radjo). This claim is not conceded by the main body of Redjang in the Highlands. The Redjang of the Upper Musi recognised no overlord, whilst those in Lebong admitted only a nominal jural supremacy to the pesirëa of the Sukau IX moiety of the Tubeui bang mego. The pesirëas of Sukau IX claim descent in a direct line from Bundo Kandung, Queen of the Alam Minangkabau realm … [48] … It is doubtful whether the pesirëa of Sukau IX ever enjoyed any real authority over the Four Pillars. The institution of radjo appears to have been at attempt by Minangkabau rantau emigrants to establish a hegemony over Redjang society in the manner of their overlordship of other societies in Central Sumatra and Djambi, In this the northernmost Redjang seem to have acquiesced nominally but the essential features of the egalitarian Four Pillar system continued unchanged. The Minangkabau immigrants, on the contrary, were gradually assimilated into Redjang society, their matrilineal institutions being replaced by the Redjang rule of patrilineal descent, patrivirilocal marriage and male primogeniture.""

""Mat Nur explained to us that according to Besemah adat a village was normally divided into four jungut and that each jungut had its poyang and its own pemipin (head, leader) who could be called the jurai tue of the jungut. But, Mat Nur went on, the real jurai tue of the village as a whole, stood outside the jungut and was not a member of any of them. The true jurai tue, Mat Nur explained, descended from the single founding ancestor of the village, from the pangkal (beginning, source, root) down a straight line from eldest son to eldest son."" (Collins, 1979, p 183)

""The feature of the jurai tue which seemed to be central both in Haji Mat Nur’s description and in the picture drawn for me by most informants is that he is the wakil (agent, deputy, representative). Although no informant volunteered to go on and specify who had deputized the wakil or on whose behalf he was the agent, it is clear from what people said about the jurai tue’s ideal role in his community that he can really be understood both as representative of the poyang to the people and representative of the people to the poyang."" (Collins, 1979, p 196-197)

""Besides being considered able to draw on his knowledge of history to make authoritative pronouncements about the moral health of his community the jurai tue is also held to possess the most reliable accounts of village precendent and tradition which enables him to mediate quarrels and disputes and to organize village cooperation. The jurai tue, my informants would say, is invited to every sedekah performed in the village. No ritual, they claimed, would be complete or possible without his presence."" (Collins, 1979, p 199)

Some jurai tue had authority over multiple villages:

""In the days before the Dutch invaded Besemah, he continued, the jurai tue of Keban Agung did not just take care of his own village but had the right to regulate and supervise twelve villages in the area of Sawah Batuan. In those days, Mat Nur said, the jurai tue were the leaders and their deliberations gave rise to the rules and laws … which kept Besemah secure, calm and orderly and in accord with the aturan (order) Atong Bungsu established for Jagat Besemah.""

(Erb, 1987, p 41). 

""The establishment of the wider system of political organization, where several gelarangs were united under one daly, and then several dalus were responsible to one raja, probably only came into existence after outside powers entered the area and were interested in collected taxes.

""Even so, informants asked about leadership matters almost invariably first of great mengal figures of past and present whose influence extended over large regions, and whose fame went further … [10] … A rising mengal finds himself and others in neighboring hamlets consulting him on intergroup affairs, and he may be called on to arbitrate disputes and otherwise take leadership.

‹ LA VIE POLITIQUE ET SOCIALE. LA CHEFFERIE. LA TENURE DU SOL. LA GUERRE. › (Dubois, 1984, pp. 219-262)

The basic social unit on Maré was the 'clan' (guhnameneng). Each clan had a chief (toka-guhnameneng):

« Le clan, la famille élargie, est la cellule de base sociale. Avec la Christianisation, la famille biologique prend de plus en plus d’autonomie. Mais autrefois, l’autorité sur ses membres était le fait des chefs de clan, toka-guhnameneng. Ceux-ci étaient, en principe, les aînes des clans aînes. » (Dubois, 1984, p. 219)

(""The clan, the enlarged family, is the basic social unit. With Christianisation, the biological family gains more and more autonomy. But in the past, authority over its members rested with the clan-chiefs, toka-guhnameneng. These were, in principle, the elders of the eldest clans."")

Clans appear to have been localised. It seems likely that they corresponded to what are called 'villages' elsewhere in the source, though this is not stated explicitly:

“L’habitat est hna-menang, de memeng, ou sa forme inverse mengen, signifient demeurer et s’asseoir. Le clan est étymologiquement la portion de pays, de gens vivant dans le même lieu, le gu-hna-meneng.” (Dubois, 1984, p 107)

(""The habitat is hna-menang, from memeng, or its reverse form mengen, meaning to abide and sit. The clan is etymologically the portion of the country, the people living in the same place, the gu-hna-meneng."")

Clans belonged to larger 'chiefdoms', pa-doku, centering on a 'chief' (doku). The role of the chief appears to have been largely ceremonial. Leadership of more practical activities appears to have been in the hands of other clans:

« La chefferie, pa-doku, dans l’esprit de gens, est l’extension du clan guhnameneng. En fait, les choses sont plus complexes. Selon le modèle théoretique, un clan autonome guhnameneng devient une chefferie padoku … En réalité, une chefferie est l’association de plusieurs guhnameneng ayant comme centre de cohesion un individu du nom de re-tok ou doku, qui est, théoriquement mais non obligatoirement, l’aîné tok du clan dominant ... [220] ... La traduction française ‹ chef › est un trahison. Le chef maréen n’est pas une ‹ caput ›. Son rôle n’est pas tellement de penser et de commander, boen qu’il le fasse, mais de recevoir les presents remis à la chefferie. » 
(Dubois, 1984, pp. 219-220)

""The chiefdom, pa-doku, in the minds of the people, is an extension of the clan (guhnameneng). In fact, the matter is more complex. In theory, an autonomous clan constitutes a chiefdom. In reality, a chiefdom is an association of many guhnameneng centred on an individual called the re-tok or doku, who is, theoretically but non necessarily, the eldest tok of the dominant clan ... The French translation ‘chief’ is misleading. The Maréan chief is not a ‘caput’. His role is not so much to think and to command, if he does so, but to receive the gifts given to the chiefdom."")

« La place d’honneur du chef est la dernière. Quand le chef se présente à la guerre, il est à la queue de ses troupes … Les chefs si Gureshaba faisaient exception à cette règle, car ils étaient aussi chefs de guerre, toa-eat. » (Dubois, 1984, p. 221)

(""The chief's place of honour is at the back. When the chief goes to war, he is at the rear of his troops ... The chiefs of si Gureshaba were an exception to this rule, for they were also war-chiefs, toa-eat."")

« Chaque clan avait sa spécialité, cultuire de telle igname, de tel taro, de telle plante alimentaire, la pêche à tel poisson, [233] la fabrication de tel filet, de telle nasse, la construction de pirogue, soigner telle maladie, la possession de tells invisibles, mo-yaac lutins (maica), faire la pluie, le soleil, le brouillard, fair la famine, etc., etc … Si la spécialité exige le concours de toute la population, pêche, guerre, etc., il y a un chef de cette spécialité, qui est toka- (chef de-); toka-ruac = chef de travail, toka-koe = captain de bateau; ou toa = ce qui soutient, toa-eat – chef de guerre. » (Dubois, 1984, pp. 232-233)

(""Each clan has its specialty, cultivation of a given yam, of a given taro, of a given food plant, catching a given fish, making a  given net, a given trap, the construction of canoes, curing a given disease, possession by given invisibles, moy-yaac elves (maica), making rain, sun, fog, famine, etc., etc. ... If the specialty requires the support of the whole population, fishing, war, etc., there is a chief of this specialty, who is toka (chief of-); toka-ruac = chief of work, toka-koe = boat captain; ou toa, he who sustains, toa-eat - war-chief."")","dubois1984[107-122, 219-262]"

'Government' (Linton, 1933, pp. 147-158)

'Religion' (Linton, 1933, pp. 159-240)

The Tanala lived in villages that were part of larger units that Linton calls 'gentes':

""All the Tanala lived in villages of from fifty to eighty families ... The village was divided into wards, each the property of a lineage."" (Linton, 1933, p 135). 

""The gens was the largest social or governmental unit recognized by the primitive Tanala. All larger groupings are directly traceable to outside influences. There was no native name for this unit, but each gens was named and considered itself a separate entity. The members of a gens always occupied a continuous territory, the limits of their land being marked by various natural boundaries such as rivers, ridges, etc. Trespass on this territory by members of another gens was cause for war ... [137] ... Each gens was composed of from one to fifty villages all of which recognised the domination of a single chief."" (Linton, 1933, pp. 136-137)

In both of the main subgroups of the Tanala (Ikongo and Menabe) there was at one time or another also a larger unit that Linton calls the 'kingdom', but this institution was far more entrenched among the Ikongo than the Menabe:

""In describing Tanala government it is necessary to treat the Menabe and Ikongo divisions separately. Until about one hundred years ago the Menabe had no political or governmental unit larger than the gens. Later, with the aid of the Imerina empire, the Zafiakotry gens succeeded in bringing several other gentes under its domination and a kingdom was established. This kingdom tried to copy the organization of the Imerina kingdom, but it never became well integrated or thoroughly organized. The Ikongo, on the other hand, had kingdoms of long standing and had developed a stable system of government with officials of varying rank."" (Linton, 1933, p 147)

Among the Ikongo, each kingdom was made up of a number of gens, each headed by a Mpanzaka ('king'), and an Anakandriana. The kingdom as a whole was also headed by a Mpanzaka and a number of Anakandriana, the foremost of whom was called Anakandriambe:

""The village government was essentially the same as the Menabe. There was an elected chief, usually not a noble, who acted as executive, and a Fokonolona ('council'). Each gens had a chief called the Mpanzaka who was elected from the members of the hova caste ... The Mpanzaka was chosen by the village chiefs and Notables of the entire gens, irrespective of caste, and could be deposed at will. Associated with him were one or more officials called Anakandriana, who were elected on the same basis and in the same way as the Mpanzaka, but must be of vahoaka ('common') caste. Theoretically the Anakandriana acted as counselors and executives, but actually they often seem to have had as much power as the Mpanzaka, who was unable to remove them from office. The whole arrangement strongly suggested a dual chieftainship.

""Kingdoms arose, as among the Menabe, through one gens acquiring domination over others. The king, also called Mpanzaka, was chosen from among the hova of the dominant group. Like the gens chiefs, he was assisted by elected Anakandriana whom he could not dismiss. These Anakandriana might be chosen from any gens within the kingdom, but were always of vahoaka caste. Usually all gentes were represented among them and they formed a sort of permanent council with a sharp check on the conduct of the Mpanzaka. They exercised executive functions and continued in office [151] from reign to reign. The most influential of the royal Anakandriana were called the Anakandriambe."" (Linton, 1933, pp. 150-151)

There were two main categories of religious specialist among the Tanala as a whole: 'priests' and 'ombiasy'. Ombiasy in general were considered superior to priests. Among the Menabe each village had a priest (Pitankazomanga). The priest of the 'mother village' of a group of villages was called Tena Pitankazomanga and had authority over the priests of the 'offspring villages'. It is unclear whether this was also the case among the Ikongo. Each village also appears to have had an ombiasy, and mention is also made of the 'leading ombiasy of the gens':

""PRIESTS. – All important sacrifices to the ancestors as a whole are performed by professional priests. Less important ones are made by heads of families. The priesthood seems to have been a direct outgrowth of the sacrificial functions of heads of families. [186] According to native belief each gens has arisen through the expansion of a single family (see Social Organization) which increased to a lineage, then to a village, and finally to a series of villages. At first the head of the family sacrificed to the ancestors, then, as the related group grew larger, the office became more formal and was vested in the head of the family which was in most direct line of descent from the gens ancestor, reckoning through eldest children. Finally through various causes such as settlement of part of the group at a distance, failure of the direct line, etc., the strict succession was broken down.

""Among the Menabe at the present time every village of long standing has its priest. When a new village is founded, the priest of the parent village is expected to come to it on request and make sacrifices there. Finally, when the new village has existed for two or three generations and lost its feeling of unity with the old village, or when the priest becomes weary of making the necessary journeys, the head of the ranking family in the new village asks permission from the original priest to assume the priestly office. This then becomes hereditary in his family. There seems to be no formal investiture for a new priest, but the office cannot be assumed without the original priest's permission. In the Zafindriantrova gens the priest of the parent village is called the Tena Pitankazomanga, those of the offshoot villages simply Pitankazomanga. The Tena Pitankazomanga officiates at sacrifices in his own village and at those performed in behalf of the group of villages as a whole. The Pitankazomanga are considered his deputies and ask his permission when they are to perform the more important sacrifices. Most of the Menabe gentes seem to have a similar, but rather less formal organization. In general, the priest of the parent village has no real control over the priests of the younger villages and there is no central religious authority, even within the gens."" (Linton, 1933, pp. 185-186)

""OMBIASY AND THE ANCESTOR CULT.—Native medicine-men or magicians, called ombiasy, have been described elsewhere (see section on Ombiasy) and only their activities in connection with the ancestor cult will be described here. They are practitioners of divination and magic and are sharply distinguished from the priests, who do not work with either. Throughout most of Madagascar the same person may not hold both offices and if an ombiasy inherits a priesthood, he must give up his magical paraphernalia and practices at once. At the same time, there is no hostility between the two groups and they are not considered rivals. The ombiasy are thought to be more skilled than the priests in everything pertaining to the supernatural and the priests constantly consult them as to the best means for propitiating the ancestors.

""Ombiasy frequently instigate sacrifices, announcing that illness or calamity is due to offended ancestral spirits, or that the spirit of so-and-so has appeared to them and demanded an offering from some one of his descendants. They are always consulted as to the most propitious time and place for communal sacrifices and for individual sacrifices as well, if the sacrificer is rich enough to pay for their services. Among the Tanala they also act as stage managers in the more important sacrifices. This results in great variation in minor details of ceremonial procedure for, although the general pattern is always the same, the ombiasy is expected to change some detail each time. If he fails to do this, there seems to be a feeling of disappointment and a tendency to doubt his ability. In general, only ombiasy belonging to the gens are allowed to manage sacrifices, for outsiders will not be familiar with the usual ritual of the group, or with the names of its ancestors. However, if a foreign ombiasy of great reputation is present, he may be asked to take charge. He consults with the priest and, when the time comes to say the invocation, stands beside him and repeats the invocation with him, the priest speaking in a low voice and the ombiasy in a loud one. Minor priests, or those who feel uncertain of their own ability, may delegate their office to the ombiasy of their village, who thenceforth both direct and perform all sacrifices. The arrangement is temporary and the office reverts to the priest's family at his death."" (Linton, 1933, p. 188)

""Among the Menabe, sacrifices on behalf of the entire gens were made only in time of national calamity, such as pestilence, very serious crop failure, or an attack which threatened to drive the gens from its territory or subjugate it. They were performed on the tops of sacred mountains, the idea being that the worshippers were thus lifted closer to heaven and their prayers made more easily audible to the gods and ancestors. Each gens had one or more of these mountains within its territory ... When there was more than one sacred mountain, the leading ombiasy of the gens, or some foreign ombiasy of great power, indicated which one should be used. He also selected the priest who was to officiate from among all those in the gens and indicated the ritual to be used, especially whether the sacrifice was to be boiled or grilled ... Sacrifices on behalf of a village or group of villages were performed before setting out on a war party. These have been described in the section on Warfare. They may have been performed on a few other occasions as well, but informants were uncertain. Since the establishment of French control they also have become obsolete."" (Linton, 1933, p. 182)

It is not clear whether any kingdom-level religious activities took place among the Menabe. Among the Ikongo there was at least one: an investiture ceremony with religious elements. Certain ombiasy played a role in the planning and performance of this ceremony, as did the Anakandrianambe and the other Anakandriana of the kingdom:

""The following account of the election and investiture of an Ikongo king is quoted from the manuscript of Sadaro Antoine: 

""'When a king had died the Anakandriambe summoned all the Anakandriana and Notables of the two castes in the kingdom to choose a new king. The hovalahy [nobles] assembled in one house and the vahoaka in another. The commoners deliberated as to who should be king and when they had decided went to the house where the nobles were assembled and designated for the office the one they liked best. This man was separated from his comrades and taken to a house in the corner of the village. There he stayed, rarely going out, until he was invested with office. A few days after the election the whole population constructed a large house, the trano be, or lapa, to be the royal residence.

""'On a fortunate day selected by an ombiasy, everyone went to the village of the new Mpanzaka to celebrate his solemn entry into the lapa. About noon all the Notables entered the house where the future king was. The Anakandriambe placed the satro mena [a red hat with a tassel] on his head, dressed him in an akanjo jaky [a dark red garment like a long shirt or smock], a lamba mena [shoulder blanket of red silk], and samboritra lamba mena [shawl of red silk]. They placed a silver necklace on his neck and a silver bracelet on his right wrist, and gave him a tehim-bolofotsy [long ebony staff encrusted with tin or silver] to carry. When everything was ready the king seated himself on his filanzana [carrying chair] which was usually the house door, and the vahoaka carried him to the royal house. They formed a procession with the chief Anakandriambe first, then the king's wife, on foot, then the king, followed by his escort of Notables, etc., and then the whole population, singing. They sounded conch shell trumpets and fired guns. The young people sang and danced to the sodina [flute] and draitra [a variety of large drum]. A public fête was organized in the village. Before entering the royal dwelling the king, followed by the population, walked around the house three times. Each time he arrived opposite the east side of the house he halted and fired a shot in the air. The first shot was in honor of the king, the second in honor of the Anakandriana, and the third in honor of the people as a whole. If the first shot failed to go off, it was a bad sign for the king. He would have a misfortune [152] or would not reign long. The ombiasy might change his destiny by bathing him with water containing magical materials, but he was sometimes dismissed then and there and another king chosen.

""'The king entered the house by the big door on the east, taking care to place his left foot on the door sill first. He seated himself on the eastern side of the house on a clean mat, his counselors on the right and his wife on the left. An ox was tied to the fatora with its head east. [The fatora was a pointed post about six feet high, usually made of teza wood. It was set up east of the royal house to commemorate the ancestors.] The Anakandriana left the house. They threw water on the roof of the house and on the ox three times, while the chief Anakandriambe said: ‘Oh Zanahary of the east, the south, the north and the west, come assist at this ceremony. We have chosen one to direct us, to counsel us and to protect us. We offer you an ox lava trafo [lit. with a long hump, i.e., fat]. We ask your protection that our new king may live and reign long, that we may be protected from all dangers, that the army of the Imerina may not come to our region, that the wild pigs and locusts may not injure our plantations, that we may be exempt from all sickness, that our women may have many children and that our wealth may be increased.’ After making this invocation the Anakandriambe entered the house and the young men of hova caste killed the ox and cut up the meat. Rice and pieces of the meat were cooked and placed on a leaf of the Traveler's Palm or a clean china plate. This was then put on a handsome mat before the east door of the house. Everyone then uncovered his head and stood silent. The Anakandriambe advanced and addressed the razana [ancestral spirits]. He invited all the ancestors of the king to take part in the repast. He explained why they had been called, then asked their protection, good fortune and prosperity. When the prayer was finished a great quantity of rice and meat was cooked and the king offered toaka [sugar cane rum] to the Anakandriana, the singers and dancers. There was a great feast. There was a great uproar in the royal house, ending in shouts of laughter. The next day the king and his family gave two or three cattle to the people. These were killed [not sacrificed] and the meat distributed to everyone. The people then returned home talking of the incidents of the ceremony.'"" (Linton, 1933, pp. 151-152)

The Anakandriana also administered 'trials by ordeal' among the Ikongo, a role that was performed by the ombiasy among the Menabe:

""Sadaro Antoine describes the tangena as follows: 'The commonest and worst form is called milela-by. One heats a flat piece of iron, usually a spade, red hot. The Anakandriana examines the tongue of the accused and searches him to make sure he has no charms concealed on his person. He then invokes the Zanahary and all the ancestors of the chief, asking them to assist at the ceremony. He asks them to punish the accused severely if he is guilty and to prevent his injury if he is innocent. The Anakandriana then picks the iron out of the fire with a pair of tongs and holds it before the victim at a moderate height. The latter opens his mouth and licks it once. After this he is placed in a house and closely guarded. The next day he is brought out and his tongue examined. If there are buttons or colored patches he is guilty, and the chief condemns him to death or to a fine according to the gravity of his offense.

""'Mangaron-drano.—Water was boiled in a large pot and a stone fastened to a cord, like a plumb-line. The stone was dropped vertically into the pot, but was not submerged. The cord was attached to a stick which rested across the mouth of the pot so that the stone hung about 5 mm above the water. The suspect's hand was washed and examined to see whether he had any scars on it, also whether it had been rubbed with medicine. After the Anakandriana had made the usual invocation, the accused approached the pot and seized the stone from below, plunging his hand into the boiling water. He then plunged his hand into cold water. The hand was bandaged and the accused shut up in a guarded house. The next morning all assembled to see his condition. If there were blisters on the hand he was guilty. If accused of sorcery he was killed on [157] the spot, or, if the king was merciful, he was expelled and all his goods seized.

""'Milano-rano.—The Tanala firmly believe that certain crocodiles are endowed with a faculty which makes it possible for them to render justice. They are employed to judge an affair which seems dark. The ceremony is held on the bank of a river inhabited by ferocious crocodiles. Everyone assembles there and keeps silence so as not to frighten the animals. The Anakandriana places an open tandra [pair of blacksmith's tongs] on the edge of the river and strikes the water three times. He invokes the Zanahary and the ancestors, asking that the accused be devoured if guilty and allowed to pass safely if innocent. When he has finished the accused advances, steps over the tandra and plunges into the river. He swims to the other bank and back. If he is guilty, the crocodiles take him, if innocent he passes safely. When he gets back all raise a cry of Vita! Vita! [Finished!] and the young people plunge into the river to receive him. After the ceremony he returns to his village and his accuser kills an ox to indemnify him.'"" (Linton, 1933, pp. 156-157)

""The legal system of the Menabe was less developed than that of the Ikongo, due to the absence of large political groupings. Nearly all their laws had been handed down from such ancient times that their origin had been forgotten. New laws could be enacted by the Notables and chief of the gens, but seem rarely to have been made. Court procedure was less formal and in civil cases the litigants were not represented by counsel, although they would seek advice from persons skilled in the law before coming into court. Evidence was taken as among the Ikongo. In criminal cases there was still less formality, the Fokonolona as a whole deciding whether the accused [158] was guilty. Fines were rarely levied, thieves being punished by a severe beating and repeated offenses by formal disownment and expulsion from the village. Trial by ordeal was less common than among the Ikongo and the ordeal was administered by an ombiasy, not by the village chief."" (Linton, 1933, pp. 157-158)

It is not clear that the king had any religious functions ‘Royal powers and functions’ (Linton, 1933, p. 153):

“A king was expected to aid and counsel his subjects, maintain order throughout the realm, lead his people in war, and above all administer justice.” (Linton, 1933, p. 153)",linton1933[132-240]

'Government' (Linton, 1933, pp. 147-158)

The local community was the village:

""All the Tanala lived in villages of from fifty to eighty families ... The village was divided into wards, each the property of a lineage."" (Linton, 1933, p 135). 

Villages were part of larger units called 'gentes' by Linton, each headed by a chief:

""The gens was the largest social or governmental unit recognized by the primitive Tanala. All larger groupings are directly traceable to outside influences. There was no native name for this unit, but each gens was named and considered itself a separate entity. The members of a gens always occupied a continuous territory, the limits of their land being marked by various natural boundaries such as rivers, ridges, etc. Trespass on this territory by members of another gens was cause for war ... [137] ... Each gens was composed of from one to fifty villages all of which recognised the domination of a single chief."" (Linton, 1933, pp. 136-137)

In both of the main subgroups of the Tanala (Ikongo and Menabe) there was at one time or another also a larger unit that Linton calls the 'kingdom', but this institution was far more entrenched among the Ikongo:

""In describing Tanala government it is necessary to treat the Menabe and Ikongo divisions separately. Until about one hundred years ago the Menabe had no political or governmental unit larger than the gens. Later, with the aid of the Imerina empire, the Zafiakotry gens succeeded in bringing several other gentes under its domination and a kingdom was established. This kingdom tried to copy the organization of the Imerina kingdom, but it never became well integrated or thoroughly organized. The Ikongo, on the other hand, had kingdoms of long standing and had developed a stable system of government with officials of varying rank."" (Linton, 1933, p 147)

The Menabe kingdom was abolished by the French:

""After the Zafiakotry conquered the neighboring gentes their Anakandriana was recognized as a king, Mpanzaka. At first he seems to have been chosen by the gens alone, like any other Anakandriana. Later he was chosen by the Anakandriana of all the gentes, the only prerequisite for office being that he must belong to the Zafiakotry gens. Still later the royal power was strengthened and it became possible for the king to nominate his successor. The king Rainilevola had children by eight of his wives and before his death indicated the succession for twelve places. Lemangivy, a son, was designated to succeed him, then Iovana, a daughter, then Raindriamanava, a son, and after him nine other sons. The mother of Raindriamanava was of ndevo caste, but his right to the succession was never questioned. During the reign of Queen Iovana he was the most influential man in the kingdom. He never became king because the French abolished the office.

""I was unable to get any coherent account of the exact powers and functions of the Menabe kings, or of their regalia, or of the ceremonies performed when they were inducted into office. No two informants were in agreement on these points and apparently they had never become formalized. The kingdom was short lived and constantly subject to Imerina influences."" (Linton, 1939, p. 149)

Presumably this was also the case among the Ikongo, since the institution of kingship is only described in the past tense.

Kingship among the Ikongo:

""The village government was essentially the same as the Menabe. There was an elected chief, usually not a noble, who acted as executive, and a Fokonolona ('council'). Each gens had a chief called the Mpanzaka who was elected from the members of the Hova caste ... The Mpanzaka was chosen by the village chiefs and Notables of the entire gens, irrespective of caste, and could be deposed at will ... Kingdoms arose, as among the Menabe, through one gens acquiring domination over others. The king, also called Mpanzaka, was chosen from among the hova of the dominant group.""

About noon all the Notables entered the house where the future king was. The Anakandriambe placed the satro mena [a red hat with a tassel] on his head, dressed him in an akanjo jaky [a dark red garment like a long shirt or smock], a lamba mena [shoulder blanket of red silk], and samboritra lamba mena [shawl of red silk]. They placed a silver necklace on his neck and a silver bracelet on his right wrist, and gave him a tehim-bolofotsy [long ebony staff encrusted with tin or silver] to carry. When everything was ready the king seated himself on his filanzana [carrying chair] which was usually the house door, and the vahoaka carried him to the royal house. They formed a procession with the chief Anakandriambe first, then the king's wife, on foot, then the king, followed by his escort of Notables, etc., and then the whole population, singing. They sounded conch shell trumpets and fired guns. The young people sang and danced to the sodina [flute] and draitra [a variety of large drum]. A public fête was organized in the village. Before entering the royal dwelling the king, followed by the population, walked around the house three times. Each time he arrived opposite the east side of the house he halted and fired a shot in the air. The first shot was in honor of the king, the second in honor of the Anakandriana, and the third in honor of the people as a whole. If the first shot failed to go off, it was a bad sign for the king. He would have a misfortune [152] or would not reign long. The ombiasy might change his destiny by bathing him with water containing magical materials, but he was sometimes dismissed then and there and another king chosen.

""'The king entered the house by the big door on the east, taking care to place his left foot on the door sill first. He seated himself on the eastern side of the house on a clean mat, his counselors on the right and his wife on the left. An ox was tied to the fatora with its head east. [The fatora was a pointed post about six feet high, usually made of teza wood. It was set up east of the royal house to commemorate the ancestors.] The Anakandriana left the house. They threw water on the roof of the house and on the ox three times, while the chief Anakandriambe said: ‘Oh Zanahary of the east, the south, the north and the west, come assist at this ceremony. We have chosen one to direct us, to counsel us and to protect us. We offer you an ox lava trafo [lit. with a long hump, i.e., fat]. We ask your protection that our new king may live and reign long, that we may be protected from all dangers, that the army of the Imerina may not come to our region, that the wild pigs and locusts may not injure our plantations, that we may be exempt from all sickness, that our women may have many children and that our wealth may be increased.’ After making this invocation the Anakandriambe entered the house and the young men of hova caste killed the ox and cut up the meat. Rice and pieces of the meat were cooked and placed on a leaf of the Traveler's Palm or a clean china plate. This was then put on a handsome mat before the east door of the house. Everyone then uncovered his head and stood silent. The Anakandriambe advanced and addressed the razana [ancestral spirits]. He invited all the ancestors of the king to take part in the repast. He explained why they had been called, then asked their protection, good fortune and prosperity. When the prayer was finished a great quantity of rice and meat was cooked and the king offered toaka [sugar cane rum] to the Anakandriana, the singers and dancers. There was a great feast. There was a great uproar in the royal house, ending in shouts of laughter. The next day the king and his family gave two or three cattle to the people. These were killed [not sacrificed] and the meat distributed to everyone. The people then returned home talking of the incidents of the ceremony.'"" (Linton, 1933, pp. 151-152)",linton1933[132-240]

""Once his legitimacy is established, the chief acquires power over the population. This comes about in several ways: the chief is seen as the only person who can safely control some supernatural resources. He also manages intercommunity relations and on these two accounts is considered indispensable."" (Rousseau, 1974, pp. 405-406)

""The chief's household owns more valuable heirlooms (daven pesaka) than those of the commoners (p. 376) … The daven pesaka also include some charms (pengaroh) which assure spiritual protection to their owner, and by extension to the rest of the community. They are at the same time the proof of the marens' [aristocrats’] spiritual strength: for a commoner to touch them would be parit (p. 106), while the marens may do so with impunity."" (Rousseau, 1974, pp. 408-409)

""The chief also controls the most important economic activity, rice cultivation, as he sets the date of the ceremonial sowing (p. 174). When excessive rains endanger the crops, he performs a ceremony to bring back dry weather (na taga'). A few old men usually join him in his ritual fasting, but they would not dare perform the ceremony without him."" (Rousseau, 1974, p. 411)

Priests and shamans:

""The priests and shamans are the intermediaries to the supernatural realm. The priests (dayong) perform the critical naming, marriage, funerary, and calendrical [428] ceremonies. The shamans (dayong na'ah) do only one kind of curing ritual. As such, religious practitioners do not have a political role. Their authority is limited to religious matters. For instance, if someone behaves improperly during a ceremonial, they demand from him the payment of a purificatory ritual. Otherwise, they are theoretically equal to those of their age and rank. However, the practice of priesthood increases one's status."" (Rousseau, 1974, pp. 427-428)

""Where there are several dayongs, one is the high priest (dayong aya’). This dignity depends on seniority and religious knowledge, and the position is assumed progressively, in the same way as for a big man. The high priest presides over communal ceremonies, although he may be replaced by a colleague. The position is not really an office, as there might be more than one dayong aya’ in a community."" (Rousseau, 1974, p. 429)

Relationship between the two:

""In some villages, the date of communal ceremonies is set by the senior priest, in other villages by the village chief; they usually consult each other. The relative influence of either individual in this process depends on their experience and personalities."" (Rousseau, 1998, p 127)",rousseau1998[127]

“Group leadership in the precolonial Marovo polity of headhunting coastal people was concentrated in the three important institutionalized positions of bangara, varane, and chiama, each of which was normally found in every corporate bububutu. The first and highest-ranking was the largely hereditary position of leader (bangara) of ‘group politics’ or binangara. The bangara held the important ancestral skulls and shell valuables of the butubutu, regulated the use of and access to the ancestral territory, kept genealogical information, organized feasts and other important ceremonial activities, as well as the manufacture and exchange of clamshell valuables, and was the most powerful among the ‘important men’ (palabatu) of his group … Each bangara had as his functionary one or more leading warriors (varane, literally ‘brave, warriorlike’’), whose responsibility was to organize and lead warriors of the butubutu (including temporary associates) in raiding, feuding, and warfare … A chiama (head priest) was likewise attached to each bangara. His job was to organize religious ceremonies and to mediate between the bangara and the spirit world on behalf of the butubutu. One of the main tasks of chiama was to secure tinamanae (foreseeable bestowal of efficacy – a causative noun construct based on mana) for the butubutu’s actities, largely through sacrifices to, and divinatory communication with, ancestral spirits (poda). Although bangara and other influential persons … could perform minor sacrifices and communicate with ancestral spirits at lesser shrines, chiama had overall responsibility for ceremonial activity at major shrines such as the oru where skulls of former bangara are kept and where human sacrifice was performed.” (Hviding, 1996, pp 86-87)

Most 'corporate butubutu' appear to have been localised in one village, though some were larger:

""Clearly, the land and sea terror- [155] ries of Marovo are not controlled by village groups as such. Rather, primary control is in the hands of the resident butubutu core, who constitute the majority of any village population, and who act on behalf of the entire butubutu. The butubutu, not the village, acts as the corporate group … Larger butubutu may have two or more villages within the puava …  as a result of ancient or more recent splits of localized groups because of enmity or, more often, overpopulation. The existence of more than one village may also result from the establishment earlier in the twentieth century of two different missions in the area of one butubutu, in which case fission may be more complete.""

'Government and classes' (Loeb, 1935/1974, pp. 141-143)

""The north and south of Nias was populated from the center. At the time of Marsden (1811) the population was already established over the entire island, and was divided into about fifty small districts. Each district was under a chief, and these were at constant war with one another. Schroder writes that there are at present thirty-seven districts and fifteen hundred and twenty-six villages in Nias.

""The district (ori) was not the oldest unit of Nias government, but, as elswhere in Indonesia, was doubtless due to Hindu influence. The government of the district actually rests in the hands of the village chief, and thus the village is the center of Niha rule ... The laws and regulations of the island are in part determined by the district and in part by the villages. The district determines the ranking order of the village chief, the measures to be used in the region, the size of bride-prices, and the relative worth of gold, pigs, and rice ... For practical purposes, the highest unit of government is the village, with its own rule, laws, and property. The heads of the villages are called si ulu in the south and salawa in the north and [142] center."" (Loeb, 1935, pp. 141-142). 

In contrast, later sources make it clear that the öri was far from universal, and that many villages were independent:

""Many areas had traditional federations of villages (öri), which legislated on rates of exchange and interest on loans, and within which headhunting and war were prohibited ... Prior to the Dutch 'revival' of the öri system, there was no political unit above village-level in the center; nor was there a paramount chief until the Dutch imposed one. Leadership in the village was informal and unstable as the prominent men of each lineage vied for supremacy. In the south the traditional ruler is the senior nobleman, the balo zi'ulu, who rules in concert with his councillors or elders. The status and functions of traditional chief and government headman overlap to some extent."" (Beatty, 1993, p. 193)

“Nias has never been united as one political unity or kingdom, but has always been a multitude of more or less independent village communities … [54] … Later on, some villages merged, forming a union of several villages (öri).” (Hummell & Telaumbanua, 2007, pp. 53-54)",hummel-telaumbanua2007[53-54]

We were told by the people in Central Bukidnon that before the coming of the Spaniards they had a principal ruler or dato who had the same power as is now exercised by the American governor – ‘when he gave orders all people obeyed.’ Each section also had its petty dato, who had a large house near which the people built their homes and had their fields. In this house lived a number of retainers and fighting men in addition to the family of the ruler. In times of danger of ceremony all the people assembled there. They worked the lands of the dato, but he afforded protection, and when they were assembled at his place, they were fed from his stores … The datos claimed the special protection of a group of spirits – Omalágad, Pamahándi, Tomanod, Molin-olin and Ibabasó – who aided them in their duties. The datos were important functionaries in in the ceremonies and were judges in all matters of dispute. If the case was a difficult one, the dato called in the headmen of the region and discussed it with them, and it is said that at times the dispute might go to the head dato. The procedure in a case is described as follows. The evidence was heard and a penalty assessed. Then the culprit and the accuser were directed to take hold of the ends of a piece of rattan, while the dato besought the spirits to watch. Next he directed the accused person to cut through the rattan with a single blow of his bolo (knife). If he failed it was a sign that he still had an evil mind and was unrepentant and deserving of additional punishment. If he succeeded the accuser was directed to cut the rattan. [80] Failure on his part indicated that he was not satisfied with the judgement and ultimately would avenge himself.

""When the datos were assured that justice had been done, they directed the two parties to exchange head-cloths as a sign that they agreed with the verdict. This done, the dato took the rattan and holding it in his hands addressed the Magbabaya, gimokod and other spirits, asking them to take notice that the parties had accepted the judgement and invoking their aid in punishing whichever one might break his promises … Some informants insisted that the office of dato was hereditary, but others stated that it only tended to be so, and that a strong leader might be chosen by the men, even though unrelated to the ruler. It does seem certain that in the Central area the children of the dato were under the protection of particular spirits and made special offerings. Polygyny was allowed to all Bukidnon but seldom practiced except by the datos. They also had more slaves than others.” (Cole, 1956, pp 79-80)",cole1956[79-80]

“There were no full-time religious specialists, but many individuals were believed to have special knowledge to influence events (e.g., every village had its rainmaker).” (Ogan, 1991, p 133)

Blackwood (1935) provides a detailed description of ‘Magic and Medicine’ (pp 462-482), and various supernatural beliefs (pp 483-573). Nothing clearly identifiable as ritual authority is mentioned. About magic specifically, Blackwood writes:

“Among the natives of North Bougainville, mana seems to belong not so much to the individual who performs the ritual acts as to the substance he uses. There are no persons set apart as ‘medicine men’ who have qualified for the post by long training or by undergoing ordeals. I am not aware of any word in these dialects which means a maker of magic, except in the case of black magic, which stands in a class by itself. Otherwise the distinction is between those who know the procedure and possess the requisite apparatus and those who do not. Thus, Sobak and Riamē were competent to act as rain-makers, Pinari was the specialist in dog magic, Minka in bonito magic, Pari in the treatment of sprains and broken bones, and so on. But Riamē could not make rain without his coco-nuts, nor Minka bring bonito without his stone fish. Again, in the description of the taro-garden ceremony given in Chapter IX it will be seen from incidents occurring in connexion with the proceedings that it did not greatly matter who actually took the principal part in washing the taro-stalks; the ēto [magical substance] was clearly regarded as the factor of primary importance.” (Blackwood, 1935, p 476)

On the other hand, the tsunaun (roughly, ‘chief’) played a ritual, though not necessarily religious, role – one of their functions was to organise ceremonies:

“Pinari, in his dual capacity of tsunaun and kukerai, claimed as much authority as he dared, and bitterly regretted that the rule of the white man had deprived him of the power of life and death. He adjudicated on disputed questions of all kinds, claimed to have a say in the marriages of the people under his jurisdiction, and arranged for the holding of all important ceremonies.” (Blackwood, 1935, p 50)

""No priests accompanied the first settlers, and consequently no specialized line of priests came down by descent. Functions of a priestly nature were discharged by the head of the group and probably were concentrated in the single line of ariki chiefs. In the 7th generation the introduction of gods necessitated the creation of a keeper of the gods. This office went to Ura or Patu-kare and probably descended in their line until the 11th generation, when the position passed to the dual ariki. The whakamaru also acted as the media of the minor gods. The acquisition of temporal power by the heads of the tribes certainly took away some of the temporal power from the dual ariki and forced them into the position of a senior priesthood. The establishment of the dual arikiship split the priestly powers exercised by the ariki so that one ariki exercised supernormal power in the air and the other on land and sea. This division of priestly power was symbolized by the words tira and papa.

""The special function of the Whakaheo was to bring about good weather during the voyages between the two atolls and to control the wind and [210] weather not only for voyaging but for fishing. The Whainga-aitu exercised his powers to induce productivity of the land and sea. If in good humor, it was said that he could invoke the sea so that fish came ashore (ka tarotaro i te moana kia haere mai te ika ki uta). On the other hand, if he were angered, he invoked his god so that the sea became rough and no fish or turtle could be procured. Both the Whakaheo and Whainga-aitu suffered from the lack of the hereditary background of scholarship that is the birthright of the established Polynesian priesthood.""

""In Mentawei the concept of government and of the family is so interwoven with the religion that it is impossible to give an idea of the native social organization without first summarizing the religious concepts ... The religious festival of the Mentawei people is called lia or punen. The lia is a family festival, is of shorter duration, and is accompanied by the sacrifice of chickens. The punen is the celebration attended by all members of the uma, men, women, and children ... The house father (ukui) conducts the lia, the priest (rimata) conducts the punen, aided by one or more seers (sikerei) ... Among the occasions on which punen are held may be included: the building of a new communal house (uma), the choice of a new priest (rimata), the making of a new communal field, the spilling of blood within the villagge, an epidemic in the village, when a tree falls in the community, and after the killing of a sacrificial animal; monkey, deer, or sea-turtle."" (Loeb, 1935, p. 173)

""As among all very primitive peoples the Mentawaians have no true chiefs, laws, or government ... When the Dutch first started governing Mentawai, they selected various rimata as the proper people to enforce their regulations, such as path building, sanitation measures, & c. This was done in the belief that the rimata were chiefs similar to the chiefs of Nias or Batakland. The fallacy of this idea soon became apparent, for not only had the rimata no special authority over the natives, outside of punen periods, but their very characters prevented them from [177] energetic enforcement of foreign edicts. The rimata are so taboo (suru, sacred) that they can do practically no work at all at all, and hence only lazy men will accept the position ... The rimata has charge of all undertakings of communal interest, since these are governed by punen regulations. He decides when the taro fields should be laid out, when a new building should be erected, and when the people should go to the fields and get food.""

21028,savu,85,2,151-2,"""At the time of the Dutch arrival, there were seven ritual territories or states on Savu, including Raijua. By the nineteenth century, primarily because of the expansion of Seba, there were five. Each state has its own priestly hierarchy, which is responsible for the conduct of its monthly cermeonies. The highest rank in this hierarchy belongs to the Deo Rai, 'Lord of the Earth;' second in rank is the Apu Lodo, 'Descendent of the Sun.' Thereafter, in the separate hierarchies, there is a variable structure of religious offices and attendant functionaries. Succession to all of these offices is strictly determined within specific clans; however, the persons selected for the offices do not perform rituals for their own clans, but on behalf of the entire state ... For all necessary rituals the priests have the right to demand appropriate sacrifices from the entire populace ... Throughout Savu, the physical person of the Deo Rai and, to a lesser extent, that of the Apu Lodo, is subject to strict priestly injunctions ... Owing to the numerous ritual restraints on the Deo Rai, it was apparently impossible for the Dutch to appoint him as ruler or regent. In fact, it is questionable whether they were, at first, aware of his existence. According to Savunese legends, the Deo Rai was invariably unable even to meet the Dutch on their arrival. When the Dutch finally recognized rulers for Savu, they seem instead to have chosen the Apu Lodo as their representative in each of the states on the island. Overlooking the ritually superior and therefore supposedly 'religious' figure in the society in order to appoint a lesser 'secular' figure as ruler was a pattern, if not a policy, that the Dutch followed on a number of islands in eastern Indonesia. On Savu this proved not to be entirely successful because the offices of Apu Lodo and of Raja were soon regarded as ritually incompatible. As a result, in each state in the course of a generation or two these offices became separated although they were generally retained within the same clan. In popular sentiment, in all but Seba, the office of Raja diminished by contrast to that of the Apu Lodo. Rather than effecting an alteration in the priestly hierarchy, the Dutch managed, at best, to bolster a few political positions almost entirely separated from it.""
