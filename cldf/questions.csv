Ethnographies do not always specify a time focus, in which case one must be inferred. If multiple time foci are defensible, the earliest that allows a detailed reconstruction of the indigenous religion should be chosen. When coding variables that have a frequency (e.g. warfare, contact with other societies), the twenty-five year period immediately preceding the time focus should be taken into consideration (cf.
