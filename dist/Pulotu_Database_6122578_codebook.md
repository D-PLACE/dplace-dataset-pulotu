## Traditional Culture

### v1: Traditional State Time Focus

A time focus is the period of time to which ethnographic data on a
particular society is applicable. Ethnographies do not always specify
a time focus, in which case one must be inferred. If multiple time
foci are defensible, the earliest that allows a detailed
reconstruction of the indigenous religion should be chosen. When
coding variables that have a frequency (e.g. warfare, contact with
other societies), the twenty-five year period immediately preceding
the time focus should be taken into consideration (cf. Ember & Ember,
1992).

### v40: Belief in god(s)

A god is a supernatural agent with a broad sphere of influence and
concern, who is not restricted to any one physical form or
geographical area, and is not believed to have originated as a human
or other corporeal being. Please provide a brief description in the
coder’s notes section.

- (?) Missing data

### v95: Belief in nature god(s)

A nature god is a supernatural agent of non-human origin, who is not
considered to be an ancestor, who has a broad sphere of influence and
concern, and who (a) is embodied in a particular feature of the
natural world or natural phenomenon and is seldom or never encountered
in any other form, and / or (b) resides in a particular natural
landscape or type of natural landscape, and is seldom encountered
anywhere else.    Please provide a brief description of principal
nature god(s) in the Coder's Notes section.

### v38: Belief in deified ancestor(s)

A deified ancestor is the spirit of a human or other corporeal being,
ancestral to at least a subset of people within the culture, who
acquired godlike powers after death. Unlike ancestral spirits, deified
ancestors have broad spheres of influence and concern (extending
beyond single families to larger units such as tribes and societies),
and are usually, though not always, believed to have lived in the
distant past.     Please provide a brief description of the principal
deified ancestor(s) in the Coder's Notes section.

### v37: Belief in ancestral spirits

An ancestral spirit is the spirit of a deceased ancestor who was once
a human or other corporeal being and continues to influence the lives
of his or her living descendents.  Unlike deified ancestors, ancestral
spirits have a narrow sphere of influence and concern (usually
confined to a single family), and are usually, though not always, the
spirits of those who lived in the recent past.

### v17: (Low) contact with other societies (SCCS v 787)

For the purposes of coding, contact with other societies is direct or
indirect contact between one or more members of the culture being
coded and one or more members of another culture. In larger cultures,
the frequency of contact with other societies may vary between
subgroups. In cases such as this, the frequency that is typical for
most political communities within the culture should be coded.

(NOTE 1: A different culture, for the purposes of this coding sheet,
is any culture other than the culture being coded.     NOTE 2: The
distance stated should be a minimum distance. For example, if the
culture being coded occupied an archipelago, and the nearest other
culture occupied an archipelago located to directly to the east, the
distance given should be the distance from the easternmost island of
the western archipelago to the westernmost island of the eastern
archipelago.     NOTE 3: If there was a different culture living on
the same island, code this distance as “0”.)

### v4: Distance to nearest continent (km)

saltwater bodies such as lagoons. Consider atolls made up of smaller
islets to be one island.     (Of island with largest population of
culture or largest island if unknown)

### v62: Costly sacrifices and offerings

Costly sacrifices and offerings are defined as the presentation of an
object of more-than-trivial value to a supernatural agent, which
involves the forfeiting of that object, or a valuable part of that
object, for any further use. Costly sacrifices and offerings may
involve inanimate objects or living beings, but for our purposes human
sacrifices should be excluded from this category.    Funeral practices
which invoke the destruction of the property of the deceased or the
burial of valuable objects with the deceased should be included in
this category, but only if there is an explicit or clearly implied
belief that the objects will benefit the deceased in some way in the
afterlife.     Please provide a brief description (including agent
sacrificed to and things sacrificed) in the Coder's Notes section.

A political community can be defined as a group of people sharing a
common jurisdiction, or if no defined leadership is present as a group
that makes important decisions by consensus on a regular basis. The
largest such group situated wholly within the culture, or dominated
politically by people from within the culture, should be coded.

- (?) Missing data

Conflict within the local community can include both interpersonal and
intergroup conflict. Only conflict that poses a realistic threat to
the cohesiveness of the community should be considered conflict for
our purposes.

- (4) Low (Conflict seldom occurs, and is almost never violent.)
- (?) Missing data

### v15: (No) internal warfare (between communities of the same society)  (SCCS v 773)

For the purposes of coding, internal warfare is warfare (i.e. lethal
conflict between two or more groups of people) that takes place at or
above the community level, but within the culture being coded. Thus
warfare between two villages belonging to the same culture, or between
two political communities (consisting of multiple villages) belonging
to the same culture would be considered internal.

- (1) Frequent, occurring at least yearly
- (2) Common, at least every five years
- (3) Occasional, at least every generation
- (4) Rare or never
- (?) Missing data

### v16: (No) external warfare (with other societies) (SCCS v 774)

For the purposes of coding, external warfare is warfare (i.e. lethal
conflict between two or more groups of people) between members of the
culture being coded and any group that is not considered part of the
culture being coded. In larger cultures, the frequency of external
warfare is likely to vary between subgroups. In cases such as this,
the frequency that is typical for most political communities within
the culture should be coded.

- (1) Frequent, occurring at least yearly
- (2) Common, at least every five years
- (3) Occasional, at least every generation
- (4) Rare or never
- (?) Missing data

### v143: Metalworking

weapons are manufactured by members of the culture and are used widely
within the culture. Manufacture must include forging, but need not
include smelting. If possible, please specify which processes and
materials are involved.

- (0) Absent
- (1) Present
- (?) Missing data

### v25: Animal husbandry as a source of food

Animals can be considered domestic if they are dependent, to an
extent, on human care. Animals that were originally domestic but have
become wild (e.g. feral pigs) should be coded under the hunting
category.

- (0) Absent
- (1) Minor
- (2) Medium
- (3) Major
- (4) Principal
- (?) Missing data

### v26: Land-based hunting performed by individuals

For the purposes of this question and the next, hunting can be
considered the killing of vertebrates for food. Invertebrates such as
crabs and insects should be coded under the gathering category.
Ethnographic literature is not always clear about whether individual
or group hunting strategies are used.  In cases of uncertainty, an
educated guess should be made if possible. For example, small animals
such as birds can be hunted by individuals, but large animals such as
pigs usually require group hunting strategies.

- (0) Absent
- (1) Minor
- (2) Medium
- (3) Major
- (4) Principal
- (?) Missing data

### v24: Land-based gathering

Gathering is defined as the collection, as opposed to hunting, of wild
foods.  These foods can include parts of plants (e.g. fruits, nuts,
roots), fungi, eggs, and small inverterbrates (e.g. insects, grubs,
worms).  Gathering does not include harvesting of fruit or nuts from
trees that have been deliberately cultivated – this should instead be
coded under “agriculture / horticulture”.

- (0) Absent
- (1) Minor
- (2) Medium
- (3) Major
- (4) Principal
- (?) Missing data

### v27: Land-based hunting performed by one or more groups

- (0) Absent
- (1) Minor
- (2) Medium
- (3) Major
- (4) Principal
- (?) Missing data

### v23: Agriculture / Horticulture

Agriculture and horticulture refer to the cultivation of plants for
food or other uses. In many parts of the Pacific, important food
plants such as bananas and coconuts are cultivated but also gathered
from the wild. Coders should try to identify which of these processes
is operating, and to what extent, before coding.

- (0) Absent (not practiced in the culture, or practiced but not a food source)
- (1) Minor (forms a relatively insignificant part of diet)
- (2) Medium (a significant food source, but not one of the most important sources of food)
- (3) Major (one of the most important sources of food)
- (4) Principal (more important than any other source of food)
- (?) Missing data

### v28: Water-based gathering

For the purposes of this question, water-based gathering can be
considered the collection of marine or freshwater plant foods (e.g.
seaweed) and of small invertebrates such as shellfish and crustaceans.

- (0) Absent
- (1) Minor
- (2) Medium
- (3) Major
- (4) Principal
- (?) Missing data

### v30: Fishing and water-based hunting performed by one or more groups

- (0) Absent
- (1) Minor
- (2) Medium
- (3) Major
- (4) Principal
- (?) Missing data

### v29: Fishing and water-based hunting performed by individuals

Fishing includes the harvesting of true fish as well as large, motile
invertebrates such as octopus and squid. Water-based hunting involves
marine or aquatic mammals (e.g. seals, dolphins), birds (e.g. ducks),
amphibians (e.g. frogs) or reptiles (e.g turtles). Opportunistic
feeding on beached whales etc. does not belong in this category, but
rather under gathering. As with hunting, it is not always clear in the
ethnographic literature whether individual or group fishing strategies
are being used. In these cases, an educated guess should be made if
possible. For example, nearshore fishing can be carried out by
individuals, but deepwater fishing usually requires a group approach.

- (0) Absent

Please provide a brief description in the Coder's Notes section.

- (1) Primarily a top-down process.
- (2) Primarily a top-down process, although inroads had already been made with the general population.

### v71: Replacement-level immigration

Replacement-level immigration, for the purposes of coding, is
migration of people from non-indigenous cultures (i.e. cultures that
were not originally present in the area) into the ancestral territory
of the culture being coded, at such a level that the cultural
demographics of the area were changed substantially. “Immigrant
population”, in this case, refers both to immigrants from another
culture and to their descendants, but excludes those who became
absorbed into the indigenous population through intermarriage or
acculturation.

- (0) Absent (Replacement-level immigration did not occur – an immigrant culture was never present in the area, or was present but had a population size less than 10% of that of the indigenous culture.)
- (1) Low (Replacement-level immigration occurred. The immigrant culture had a population size more than 10% of that of the indigenous culture at one time or another, but this figure never exceeded 50%.)
- (2) Medium (Replacement-level immigration occurred. The immigrant culture had a population size more than 50% of that of the indigenous population at one time or another, but this figure never exceeded 100%.)
- (3) High (Replacement-level immigration occurred. At one time or another during the post-contact period the immigrant culture had a population size more than 100% of that of the indigenous population.)

### v74: Foreign government systems

A foreign government system need not imply political dominance by
foreigners. A country may be politically independent and be governed
by indigenous people, but have a system of government that is of
foreign origin.

- (0) Absent (At no time during the post-contact period was the culture subject to a foreign government system.)
- (1) Present, but of low importance (At one time or another during the post-contact period, the culture was subject to a foreign government system, but this government system never controlled most important decisions.)

Means of subsistence can incorporate new features (e.g. new
technologies) without being fundamentally changed.

- (1) Low (Principal and major means of subsistence have not changed from their indigenous states.)

- (?) Missing data

### v77: Exportation of goods to other cultures

Please provide a brief description of major trading partners and types
of goods traded in the Coder's Notes section.

For the purposes of coding, motor vehicles are not considered to
include boats.

- (0) Absent (At no time during the post-contact period did most members of the culture have access either to roads or motor vehicles.)

### v70: Nature of loss of autonomy – voluntary vs. forced

Was autonomy ceded voluntarily or by force?    If autonomy was lost
more than once and differing levels of force  were involved, please
code the highest level of force used.

## Current Culture

### v88: Contemporary Time Focus

The contemporary state coding sheet should describe the culture as it
is at or around the time of coding. The time focus, then, should be as
recent and narrow as is practical.    This can be stated in the form
of a calendar year or an interval, e.g. (2000-2010).

### v92: Syncretism – Unofficial

Syncretism, for our purposes, is the fusion of features from the
indigenous religion of the culture with features from one or more
world religions.  Unofficial syncretism is syncretic belief and / or
practice that occurs outside of a religious institution and is not
explicitly endorsed by that institution. Only syncretic beliefs and /
or practices that survived to the present day or recent past should be
considered.

### v91: Religious Syncretism – Institutional

Syncretism, for our purposes, is the fusion of features from the
indigenous religion of the culture with features from one or more
world religions.  Institutional syncretism is syncretic belief and /

religious institution, e.g. a church.. Only syncretic beliefs and / or
practices that survived to the present day or recent past should be
considered.
